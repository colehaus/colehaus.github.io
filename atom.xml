<p>You’ve probably heard claims about middle class American income stagnating over the past decades and most of the gains in productivity going to the top X%. The following table lists studies that looked at income trends in the US over time. Which of these methods of income analysis sounds like it’s closest to measuring something you’d actually be interested in knowing?</p>

<p>Due in part to the one-child policy, there were 120 Chinese men for every 100 Chinese women as of 2005—in some provinces this ratio is as high as 130 to 100.

[…] This places a lot of pressure on Chinese families with sons to demonstrate their value through homeownership.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>We found that home prices are higher and home sizes are bigger in cities with more skewed sex ratios. Strikingly, the sex ratio imbalance explained between half and one-third of the increase in housing prices in 25 major cities between 2003 and 2009.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="getting-food">Getting food</h1>
<h2 id="foraging">Foraging</h2>
<p>Anatomically modern humans showed up to the party rather late—perhaps as late as only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/26/science/when-humans-became-human.html">130,000 years ago</a>. This was right also right around the time <em>Homo sapiens</em> become <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-the-use-of-ochre-tells-us-about-the-capabilities-of-our-african-ancestry-47081">cognitively modern and capable of symbolic thought</a>. But looking good and thinking symbolically do not a good party make. Everyone would have been leaning against the wall and stealing furtive glances at each other for many millennia until they worked up the courage to finally invent language and talk to each other around 50,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So, regardless of what you use as your benchmark for modernity—anatomic, cognitive, or linguistic, the advent of food production in around 8,000 B.C.E. is relatively recent. That means, for most of human history, we’ve been foragers. “Foragers” are often called “hunter-gatherers” but this name is somewhat misleading. Hunting and gathering each typically contribute about 25-35% of caloric intake while fishing constituted the remaining 30-50%.</p>
<p>There is ongoing debate about just how sweet the pre-historic foraging life was. On one hand, per capita GDP between $90 and $200 for essentially forever doesn’t sound so hot <span class="citation" data-cites="delong1998estimating">(DeLong <a href="#ref-delong1998estimating">1998</a>)</span> from the perspective of modernity. On the other hand, as we mentioned in <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/anthropological-clickbait/">a previous post</a>, even modern foragers (who are typically thought to live in more marginal territory than early foragers) work fairly little. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people">!Kung</a> spend only about 42 hours on foraging, housework and tool-making all together. On the third hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zerzan">John <span class="noted">“You’ve to break a few billion eggs to make an omelet”</span></a><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> Zerzan</a> is on the primitivist side so no thank you.</p>
<h2 id="food-production">Food production</h2>
<p>Like we said, the earliest food production arose in around 8,000 B.C.E. in the Near East.</p>
<p>Food production perhaps arose because it was the only way to support increased population. At some point, new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society">bands</a> of humans simply ran out of unoccupied territory to move into. Thereafter, population density would have increased beyond what foraging could support and horticulture, more productive per unit area than foraging, would have been the only option. This commonsensical theory of the rise of food production is called the Binford-Flannery model.</p>
<p>An alternative theory is that climate change reduced the availability of wild food supplies.</p>
<p>Regardless of the origin story, there are three major categories of food production:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Horticulture</dt>
<dd>“Plant cultivation carried out with relatively simple tools and methods”. Probably the earliest form of food production. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_cultivation">Shifting cultivation</a>, in which land is worked temporarily and then abandoned while soil nutrients naturally replenish, is a common form. 60 of 186 <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> cultures are horticultural (variable 246) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Intensive agriculture</dt>
<dd>“Food production characterized by the permanent cultivation of fields and made possible by the use of the plow, draft animals or machines, fertilizers, irrigation, water-storage techniques, and other complex agricultural techniques.” 57 of 186 <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> cultures are intensively agricultural (variable 246) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Pastoralism</dt>
<dd>“A form of subsistence technology in which food-getting is based directly or indirectly on the maintenance of domesticated animals.” 16 of 186 cultures <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> are pastoral (variable 246) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="economic-systems">Economic systems</h1>
<h2 id="allocation-of-resources">Allocation of resources</h2>
<h3 id="land">Land</h3>
<p>Land ownership patterns tend to covary with food-getting patterns. Typically:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Foraging</dt>
<dd>No individual ownership of land. Sometimes, territoriality by collective groups when sources of food are abundant and predictable.
</dd>
<dt>Horticulture</dt>
<dd>No individual ownership of land. Sometimes plots are assigned for use.
</dd>
<dt>Pastoralism</dt>
<dd>Grazing land held communally. Herds owned individually.
</dd>
<dt>Intensive agriculture</dt>
<dd>Individual ownership of land.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="conversion-of-resources">Conversion of resources</h2>
<p>Alas, clothes, tools and other products don’t grow on trees. Raw resources must be converted into final products. <span class="citation" data-cites="ember2014">(Ember, Ember, and Peregrine <a href="#ref-ember2014">2014</a>)</span> categorizes these production processes as follows (I’ll note that these categories seem a bit haphazard to me):</p>
<dl>
<dt>Domestic</dt>
<dd>“Labor consisted of people getting food and producing shelter and implements for themselves and their kin.”
</dd>
<dt>Industrial</dt>
<dd>“Because machines and materials are costly, only some individuals (capitalists), corporations, or governments can afford the expenses of production. Therefore, most people in industrial societies labor for others as wage earners.”
</dd>
<dt>Tributary</dt>
<dd>“[M]ost people still produce their own food but an elite or aristocracy controls a portion of production, including the products of specialized crafts.”
</dd>
<dt>Post-industrial</dt>
<dd>“Businesses are now more knowledge and service oriented. … [W]hen information and knowledge become more important than capital equipment, more people can own and have access to the productive resources of society.”
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="distributing-resources">Distributing resources</h2>
<p>Resources and products are also distributed and redistributed within groups. <span class="citation" data-cites="ember2014">(Ember, Ember, and Peregrine <a href="#ref-ember2014">2014</a>)</span> has the following categories (which, pleasingly, line up pretty well with <a href="http://www.rmt.ucla.edu/">relational models theory</a>):</p>
<dl>
<dt>Reciprocity</dt>
<dd>“Giving and taking without the use of money”. Divided into generalized reciprocity—“Gift giving without any immediate or planned return”—and balanced reciprocity—“Giving with the expectation of a straightforward immediate or limited-time trade”.
</dd>
<dt>Redistribution</dt>
<dd>“the accumulation of goods or labor by a particular person or agency […] for the purpose of subsequent distribution.” Most important in societies with political hierarchies.
</dd>
<dt>Market exchange</dt>
<dd>“Transactions in which the”prices&quot; are subject to supply and demand“. Interestingly, anthropologists suggest that money arose in service of noncommercial”payments&quot; like taxes. This differs from the economic account in which money arose to solve the problem of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants">coincidence of wants</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="social-stratification">Social stratification</h1>
<p>We can categorize the patterns of resource distribution. The resources to be analyzed are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Economic resources</dt>
<dd>“Things that have value in a culture, including land, tools and other technology, goods, and money.”
</dd>
<dt>Power</dt>
<dd>“The ability to make others do what they do not want to do or influence based on the threat of force.” (If you’re not satisfied with this definition, many others are discussed in <span class="citation" data-cites="steven1974power">(Steven <a href="#ref-steven1974power">1974</a>)</span>.)
</dd>
<dt>Prestige</dt>
<dd>“Being accorded particular respect or honor.”
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And the possible distributions are egalitarian, rank and class/caste:</p>
<figure>

</table>
</figure>
<p>In every society, there is individual variation along these dimensions. <span class="citation" data-cites="ember2014">(Ember, Ember, and Peregrine <a href="#ref-ember2014">2014</a>)</span> emphasizes that the key distinction is <span class="noted">whether there are <em>groups</em> with systematically unequal access</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A caste system is a closed class system in which class is assigned at birth and virtually immutable. Marriage is also confined to caste boundaries.</p>
<p><abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> reports that 65 of 186 cultures are egalitarian, 52 have hereditary slavery and 69 have classes <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>. (Rank is not one of the categories for variable 158.)</p>
<p>The table above raises an obvious question? Are there other patterns of social stratification? For example, societies where there is equal access to economic resources but unequal access to power and prestige. Perhaps this is impossible because inequalities of power are always leveraged to produce inequalities of economic resources. But it’s not perfectly obvious to me why you couldn’t tell a similar story about unequal prestige inevitably snowballing into more comprehensive inequality.</p>
<h1 id="sex-and-gender">Sex and Gender</h1>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="ember2014">(Ember, Ember, and Peregrine <a href="#ref-ember2014">2014</a>)</span> offers four explanations of differing gender roles from the anthropological literature. None are wholly convincing:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Strength theory</dt>
<dd>“[M]ales generally possess greater strength and a superior capacity to mobilize their strength in quick bursts of energy.” Men then pursue activities which take advantage of this.
</dd>
<dt>Compatibility-with-child-care theory</dt>
<dd>“In most societies, women breast-feed their children, on average, for two years, so the compatibility-with-child-care theory suggests that for much of human history it would have been maladaptive to have women take on roles that interfere with their ability to feed their child regularly or put their child in danger while taking care of them.”
</dd>
<dt>Economy-of-effort theory</dt>
<dd>This theory suggests that certain tasks are related in their required skills, knowledge, location, etc. and will thus be performed by one gender. When paired with one of the other theories, this can fill in some gaps. For example, men may make wooden instruments (which is not obviously tied to maleness) because they generally lumber (which strength theory suggests is tied to maleness) and knowledge of wood is useful for both tasks.
</dd>
<dt>Expendability theory</dt>
<dd>“The idea that men, rather than women, will tend to do the dangerous work in a society because the loss of men is not as great a disadvantage reproductively as the loss of women is called the expendability theory.”
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="marriage-and-the-family">Marriage and the family</h1>
<p>“[P]hysical anthropologists surmise that [more or less permanent male-female bonding was] possibly in place over a million years ago”.</p>
<h2 id="explanations-of-marriage">Explanations of marriage</h2>
<p>The durability and prevalence of marriage (or something like it) demand an explanation. Here are some of the attempts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Gender division of labor</dt>
<dd>“As long as there is a division of labor by gender, society has to structure a way for women and men to share the products of their labor.” Obviously, marriage isn’t the only possible solution.
</dd>
<dt>Prolonged infant dependency</dt>
<dd>“The burden of prolonged child care by human females may limit the kinds of work they can do. They may need the help of a man to do certain types of work, such as hunting, that are incompatible with child care.” Again, it’s not obvious that a dyad is a better solution to this problem than general cooperation within a band.
</dd>
<dt>Sexual competition</dt>
<dd>“[Society] had to develop some way of minimizing the rivalry among males for females to reduce the chance of lethal and destructive conflict.” Yet again, other solutions seem possible.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="economic-exchange">Economic exchange</h2>
<p>“In about 75 percent of the societies known to anthropology, one or more explicit economic transactions take place before or after the marriage.”</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bride price</dt>
<dd>“A substantial gift of goods or money given to the bride’s kin by the groom or his kin at or before the marriage.” Occurs in 71 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 208) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Bride service</dt>
<dd>“Work performed by the groom for his bride’s family for a variable length of time either before or after the marriage.” Occurs in 24 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 208) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.

</dd>
<dt>Dowry</dt>
<dd>“A substantial transfer of goods or money from the bride’s family to the bride. [S]ocieties with dowry tend to be those in which women contribute relatively little to primary subsistence activities, there is a high degree of social stratification, and a man is not allowed to be married to more than one woman simultaneously. [… One] theory is that the dowry is intended to attract the best bridegroom for a daughter in monogamous societies with a high degree of social inequality.” Occurs in 9 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 208) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.

<dl>
<dt>Exogamy</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Independent family</dt>
<dd>“A family unit consisting of one monogamous (nuclear) family, or one polygynous or one polyandrous family.” Occurs in 70 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 80) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Extended family</dt>
<dd>“A family consisting of two or more single-parent, monogamous, polygynous, or polyandrous families linked by a blood tie.” Occurs in 109 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 80) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why are extended families so prevalent? One explanation is that “extended-family households come to prevail in societies that have incompatible activity requirements—that is, requirements that cannot be met by a mother or a father in a one-family household. In other words, extended-family households are generally favored when the work a mother has to do outside the home (cultivating fields or gathering foods far away) makes it difficult for her to also care for her children and do other household tasks.”</p>
<h1 id="marital-residence-and-kinship">Marital residence and kinship</h1>
<h2 id="marital-residence">Marital residence</h2>
<p>Many societies have widespread norms about where married couples reside in relation to their families:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Neolocal</dt>
<dd>“A pattern of residence whereby a married couple lives separately, and usually at some distance, from the kin of both spouses.” Occurs in 9 of 185 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 69) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>. Thought to be related to the presence of a commercial economy which reduces need for direct aid from family members.
</dd>
<dt>Patrilocal</dt>

<h2 id="kinship">Kinship</h2>
<p>In noncommercial societies, kinship is often the main organizing structure of society. The parts of this kinship structure that are considered salient vary from society to society:</p>
<h3 id="unilineal-descent">Unilineal descent</h3>
<p>In unilineal descent, important kin are determined through descent links of a single, consistent sex. Depending on the salient sex you get:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Patrilineal descent</dt>
<dd>“The rule of descent that affiliates individuals with kin of both sexes related to them through men only.” For example, your father, your father’s siblings and your father’s father would all be part of your kin group while your mother, your mother’s siblings and your father’s mother would not be. Occurs in 75 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 70) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Matrilineal</dt>
<dd>“The rule of descent that affiliates individuals with kin of both sexes related to them through women only.” For example, your mother, your mother’s siblings and your mother’s mother would all be part of your kin group while your father, your father’s siblings and your mother’s father would not be. Occurs in 26 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 70) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is also variation in how tight the unilineal boundaries are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Lineage</dt>
<dd>“A set of kin whose members trace descent from a common ancestor through known links.”
</dd>
<dt>Clan/sib</dt>
<dd>“A set of kin whose members believe themselves to be descended from a common ancestor or ancestress but cannot specify the links back to that founder[.]”
</dd>
<dt>Phratry</dt>
<dd>“A unilineal descent group composed of a number of supposedly related clans (sibs).”
</dd>
<dt>Moiety</dt>
<dd>Every member of society claims to be a member of one of two unilineal descent groups.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="ambilineal">Ambilineal</h3>
<p>“The rule of descent that affiliates individuals with groups of kin related to them through men or women. […] In other words, some people in the society affiliate with a group of kin through their fathers; others affiliate through their mothers.” Occurs in 6 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 70) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="double-unilineal">Double unilineal</h3>
<p>“A system that affiliates individuals with a group of matrilineal kin for some purposes and with a group of patrilineal kin for other purposes.” Occurs in 10 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 70) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="bilateral-kinship">Bilateral kinship</h3>
<p>“The type of kinship system in which individuals affiliate more or less equally with their mother’s and father’s relatives.” Because each individual has an idiosyncratic kin group (my matrilineal and patrilineal kin, considered together, are distinct from both my mother’s and my father’s kin), there are no corporate kin groups under this system. Occurs in 69 of 186 cultures in the <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> (variable 70) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="associations-and-interest-groups">Associations and interest groups</h1>
<p>Anthropologists define associations as groupings satisfying the following criteria: - Institutionalized structure - Exclusion of some people - Common interest or purpose - Members with a sense of pride and belonging</p>
<h2 id="non-voluntary">Non-voluntary</h2>
<p>In many societies, non-voluntary associations are important. They tend to take on increased importance when, for whatever reason, kin groups are an inadequate organizational structure. Common types of non-voluntary association include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Age-grade</dt>
<dd>An association comprised of all individuals who fall within a particular, culturally distinguished age range.
</dd>
<dt>Age-set</dt>
<dd>An association comprised of all individuals of a particular sex who fall within a particular, culturally distinguished age range.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="voluntary">Voluntary</h2>
<p>There are also, of course, voluntarily associations. Since these are more familiar to the reader, I presume, and less easily generalizable, nothing more on them will be said here.</p>
<h1 id="political-life">Political life</h1>
<p>Political organizations also operate on many different scales:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Band</dt>
<dd>“A fairly small, usually nomadic local group that is politically autonomous.” Typically, bands have fewer than 100 members. Most recent foragers live in bands so some anthropologists believe that essentially all humans lived in bands until the advent of agriculture.
</dd>
<dt>Tribe</dt>
<dd>“The kind of political organization in which local communities mostly act autonomously but there are kin groups (such as clans) or associations (such as age-sets) that can temporarily integrate a number of local groups into a larger unit.” Tends to co-occur with simple food production (i.e. horticulture and pastoralism) and has somewhat higher population density as a result.
</dd>
<dt>Chiefdom</dt>
<dd>“A political unit, with a chief at its head, integrating more than one community but not necessarily the whole society or language group.” This is arguably the first form of political organization where there’s formal political authority.
</dd>
<dt>State</dt>
<dd>“An autonomous political unit with centralized decision making over many communities with power to govern by force[.]” Co-occurs with intensive agriculture and high population densities. The earliest states arose, apparently independently, after about 3500 B.C.E. in Iraq, Mexico, India, China and Egypt.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Over time, political complexity seems to increase along this scale. One explanation of this trend is that higher population densities and greater political organization all but ensure victory during military conflict.</p>
<h1 id="religion-and-magic">Religion and magic</h1>
<p>Belief in the supernatural is universal and, based on material remains of funeral rites, dates to at least 60,000 years ago. Common supernatural beliefs include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Animism</dt>
<dd>“A belief in a dual existence for all things—a physical, visible body, and a psychic, invisible soul.”
</dd>
<dt>Mana</dt>
<dd>“A supernatural, impersonal force that inhabits certain objects or people and is believed to confer success and/or strength.”
</dd>
<dt>Taboo</dt>
<dd>“A prohibition that, if violated, is believed to bring supernatural punishment.”
</dd>
<dt>Gods</dt>
<dd>“Supernatural beings of nonhuman origin who are named personalities; often anthropomorphic.”
</dd>
<dt>Spirits</dt>
<dd>“Unnamed supernatural beings of nonhuman origin who are beneath the gods in prestige and often closer to the people; may be helpful, mischievous, or evil.”
</dd>
<dt>Ghosts</dt>
<dd>“Supernatural beings who were once human; the souls of dead people.”
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Supernatural beliefs plausibly shape and are shaped by society. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Societies with punitive child-rearing tend to believe in malevolent gods while societies with less punitive child-rearing practices tend to believe in benevolent gods.</li>
<li>Societies with substantial political hierarchy tend to believe in the existence of a “high god” with supreme authority.</li>
<li>Moralizing gods are more common in societies with substantial wealth inequality.</li>
</ul>
<p>People also put their supernatural belief into practice. There are several core types of supernatural practitioners:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Shamans</dt>
<dd>A religious intermediary, usually part-time, whose primary function is to cure people through sacred songs, pantomime, and other means; sometimes called witch doctor by Westerners.
</dd>
<dt>Sorcerers and witches</dt>
<dd>Sorcerers use tangible ritual materials in an attempt to harm people. Witches attempt to harm people through emotion and thought alone.
</dd>
<dt>Mediums</dt>
<dd>Part-time religious practitioners who are asked to heal and divine while in a trance.
</dd>
<dt>Priests</dt>
<dd>Generally full-time specialists, with very high status, who are thought to be able to relate to superior or high gods beyond the ordinary person’s access or control.

<p>It seems to me that making theses distinctions precise requires a lot more work. For example, you can trivially call the wealthiest 10% of people in a society in a group and then you definitionally have groups with unequal access to economic resources—the 10% and everyone else. You could rule this kind of trick out and say that the groups have be defined by some <em>other</em> criteria: say sex or age. But this doesn’t really seem to match our intuitive understanding of inequality. I wouldn’t think that a society in which toddlers are reliably less wealthy than adults is a breach of justice. My best guess at a more careful definition is that a society is <em>pro tanto</em> socially stratified if there is unequal access that persists over years and generations.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p>

    <updated>2018-12-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve already established that I’m a fan of <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/why-opposition-pigovian-taxes/">Pigouvian taxes</a> and correcting externalities. The harms I visit on my neighbor should be the result of malice aforethought; we should have to look each other in the eye rather than shrug in world-weary acknowledgment of systemic perversities. Because of that interest, I wanted a sense of the total magnitude of Pigouvian taxation possible. Are American GDP numbers the result of accounting fraud that would put <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron">Enron</a> to shame? How much would American production numbers decrease if we accounted for externalities? If the federal government shared my zeal for technocratic delights, how much of the federal budget could be funded by Pigouvian taxes? How much would an individual’s annual expenses increase if they’d internalized all their externalities and been absolved of their sins?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, I reviewed the academic literature and found every proposed Pigouvian tax I could. I did not include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>General sin taxes</dt>
<dd>Public health practitioners and others sometimes talk about taxing certain goods on the grounds that they correct for irrationality. <del>Plebes</del> People don’t know about the long-term harmful effects of sugary drinks or lack self-control, for example. Or cigarette taxes should be increased to stop people from <del>enjoying themselves</del> killing themselves prematurely. While there are reasonable arguments (despite the snark above) in support of such taxes, these aren’t the same as Pigouvian taxes. Pigouvian taxes correct for externalities and arise even with rAtIoNaL actors due to inherent failures of markets; these other taxes try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)">nudge</a> toward actions that don’t create externalities and wouldn’t occur with rAtIoNaL actors.
</dd>
<dt>Uncalibrated taxes</dt>
<dd>There are many jurisdictions that have taxes on externality-producing consumption—think cigarette taxes or alcohol taxes. However, these are just as likely to be the result of smoky backroom deals as of analysis grounded in an estimation of the externalities imposed by consumption. Thus, I excluded them and only looked for taxes (real or proposed) where numbers were intended to precisely ‘internalize’ externalities.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The results of this review are presented in the table below. The externalities associated with emitting carbon and driving are the largest by far. If we sum up all the known externalities listed in the table, we find that they come to $679 billion per year in the US. This is around 3.5% of US GDP and around 15% of <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-spending-3305763">US federal spending</a>. The per capita cost of these externalities is around over $2150 per year. (The sum of externalities is described on annual basis and so excludes quantities which are stocks rather than annual flows. In particular, obesity and <abbr title="Small and medium enterprises">SME</abbr> debt are current totals rather than annual changes.)</p>

<p>Everyone knows they’re killing the planet one mile at a time when they drive. What’s perhaps less obvious is that this is the least terrible thing about driving. The table below shows estimates of <span class="noted">the many external costs of driving</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. While driving’s contribution to global warm costs 8.5 cents per gallon, the external costs of collisions clock in at 73 cents per gallon. The proper Pigouvian tax that would internalize all the externalities is estimated at $2.15 per gallon. This is substantially larger than the current fuel tax in the US which <a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/consumer-information/motor-fuel-taxes">averages 48 cents per gallon</a> and is, interestingly, substantially lower than the current fuel tax in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_tax">many European countries</a>.</p>

<dt>Congestion</dt>
<dd>When I pile into a traffic jam, everyone behind me is slowed down yet more.

<dt>Accidents</dt>
<dd>“[W]hen I drive, I make it more likely that you will be in an accident. That is an external cost, which from an economic standpoint is equivalent to pollution. The numbers here are staggering. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are more than 30 million traffic accidents a year.

<p>Okay, I lied when I said $2.15 per gallon “would internalize all the externalities”. There are more externalities not in that table (omitted because their harms don’t track fuel and mileage very well) because driving is a slow-motion apocalypse:</p>

<p>America has, variously, a <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/rising-obesity-united-states-public-health-crisis">crisis</a>, an epidemic <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2007obesity">(Wang and Beydoun <a href="#ref-wang2007obesity">2007</a>)</span>, and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Apocalypse-Conspiracy/dp/1941188117">apocalypse</a> of obesity. Regardless of the descriptor, <span class="citation" data-cites="finkelstein2009annual">(Finkelstein et al. <a href="#ref-finkelstein2009annual">2009</a>)</span> finds that the obese spend almost $1,500 more per year on medical services and that <span class="noted">Medicare and Medicaid account for at least half of this increased spending</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. “We estimate that a 1-unit increase in BMI for every adult in the United States would increase annual public medical expenditures (i.e., direct medical costs) by $38.7 billion; an average marginal cost of $175 per year per unit of BMI for each adult in the United States.” <span class="citation" data-cites="parks2012marginal">(Parks et al. <a href="#ref-parks2012marginal">2012</a>)</span></p>
<p>This is probably the right moment to bring up (<a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/why-opposition-pigovian-taxes/#non-uniform-marginal-cost">again</a>) that Pigouvian taxes are not a good response to all externalities <span class="citation" data-cites="fleischer2015curb">(Fleischer <a href="#ref-fleischer2015curb">2015</a>)</span>. In particular, a one point increases in BMI is very harmful to the health of some while it’s healthful for others. Thus, a tax which penalizes all weight gain equally could be called a Procrustean Pigouvian tax. It’s also worth pointing out that the optimal weight from a public health perspective isn’t settled <span class="citation" data-cites="afzal2016change">(Afzal et al. <a href="#ref-afzal2016change">2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>(One very dubious part of <span class="citation" data-cites="manning1989">(Manning et al. <a href="#ref-manning1989">1989</a>)</span> is that it counts harms to family members as internal rather than external.)</p>
<p>Because “nearly all external costs are caused by 10% of the drinking population who consume one-third to one-half of all alcohol sold” <span class="citation" data-cites="cnossen2007">(Cnossen <a href="#ref-cnossen2007">2007</a>)</span> a targeted tax on excess drinking as <span class="citation" data-cites="manning1989">(Manning et al. <a href="#ref-manning1989">1989</a>)</span> calculates would be the first best option. Alas, it’s far from obvious how this targeting would be implemented. We adjust the tax to look at total alcohol consumption then. <span class="citation" data-cites="manning1989">(Manning et al. <a href="#ref-manning1989">1989</a>)</span> reports that 40% of alcohol consumption is in excess of two drinks per day (their definition of ‘excess drinking’). Multiplying “Total net costs” by 0.4 gets us the final cost of $1.10 per ounce ($37 per liter) which appears in the top table. (<span class="citation" data-cites="harwood2000updating">(Harwood <a href="#ref-harwood2000updating">2000</a>)</span> gives a broadly similar estimate of $62 per liter.)</p>
<p><!-- The widely cited study by Leung and Phelps (1993) reviewed the results of studies estimating the price elasticity of alcohol demand. Although the studies show considerable variation, the broad pattern of results would be consistent with elasticities of -0.3 for beer, -1.0 for wine, and -1.5 for spirits. --> <!-- Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) find that the long-run elasticity in a model with addiction is some 50 per cent higher than the short-run elasticity --> <!-- One of the most widely cited studies, by Leung and Phelps (1993), concludes that the price elasticities of alcohol demand are −0.3 for beer, −1.0 for wine and −1.5 for spirits. Clements et al. (1997) report price elasticities for seven countries (including three EU member states, i.e. Finland, Sweden and the UK), covering the period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. They find elasticities of −0.35 for beer, −0.68 for wine and −0.98 for spirits, which are broadly in line with those found for the US. --> <!-- Intuitively, moderate drinkers should be more price responsive than heavy drinkers. Indeed, Manning et al. (1995) found that the median drinker had a price elasticity of −1.19, whereas light and heavy drinkers’ price elasticities were around −0.5. Specifically, the price elasticity of the heaviest drinkers (those in the 95th percentile) was found to be not significantly different from zero. At the 80th percentile, however drinkers were still significantly responsive to price, with a price elasticity of −0.74. In a recent study, Farrell et al. (2003) argue that higher duties would reduce alcohol dependence and abuse, estimating a high price elasticity of −1.487. This confirms the results of an earlier study by Kenkel (1993), who estimated the demand for heavy drinking to be at least as price elastic as the demand for moderate drinking. --></p>

<p>I know we’re not supposed to speak ill of that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMpZ0TGjbWE">most sacred American—the farmer</a>—but modern intensive agriculture creates lots of external harms in the process of food production. Broadly, these harms can be categorized as harms to natural capital and harms to human health. They total up to $34 billion and are broken down in more detail in the following table:</p>

<h1 id="smoking">Smoking</h1>
<p>We finally reach the other classic sin tax—smoking. Surprisingly, there seems to be fairly widespread belief that cigarette taxes are, if anything, too high to be justified on purely Pigouvian grounds. <span class="citation" data-cites="manning1989">(Manning et al. <a href="#ref-manning1989">1989</a>)</span> is the seminal paper in this area and it answers its titular question in the affirmative—smokers do pay their way. The basic mechanism is that while “nonsmokers subsidize smokers’ medical care and group life insurance, smokers subsidize nonsmokers’ pensions and nursing home payments” <span class="citation" data-cites="manning1989">(Manning et al. <a href="#ref-manning1989">1989</a>)</span>. The breakdown showing this follows:</p>

<p>Even at a 5% discount rate, which produces the highest estimate of external harms (other discount rates actually suggest that cigarette consumption has net positive externalities), $0.54 per pack is less than the current federal cigarette tax of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_taxes_in_the_United_States">$1.01 per pack</a>.</p>
<p>All that said, there are several acknowledged omissions in these estimates. The big one is environmental tobacco smoke (ETS; secondhand smoke). At the time of the studies (and perhaps still?), the precise health effects of ETS were unknown so the costs weren’t included in the above estimates. <span class="citation" data-cites="chaloupka2000economics">(Chaloupka and Warner <a href="#ref-chaloupka2000economics">2000</a>)</span> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
The potential role of ETS costs in reevaluating the net negative externalities associated with smoking is seen by considering the following figures. Manning et al. (1991) noted that inclusion of the costs of 2,400 lung cancers from ETS (a fairly conservative estimate of this toll (Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) ) as external costs would add approximately 19 cents per pack in external costs (updated to 1994 dollars). In addition, inclusion of the costs of neonatal care for smoking-related low- birth-weight babies would add 3 cents to the total, while including fetal deaths attributable to smoking would add yet another 19 cents. Deaths from smoking-related fires would add a further 9 cents. The ETS costs would skyrocket if one included the estimated 30,000-60,000 heart disease deaths recently associated with ETS (Glantz and Parmley, 1995), adding perhaps 70 cents to the total social costs per pack. Similarly, inclusion of the smoking-induced respiratory tract infections and cases of aggravated asthma in children (Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) would boost the total further, as would inclusion of the long-term developmental disabilities in smoking-related low-birth-weight babies (Hay, 1991). All told, the social costs per pack could easily mount toward several dollars if all of the health hazards associated with ETS are real, many are treated as external to the basic consuming unit, and if all or even a significant fraction of the associated costs are included.

<h1 id="antibiotics">Antibiotics</h1>
<p>The majority of antibiotics used in the US are used for animal agriculture (it’s those beloved farmers again)—<a href="https://assets.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/better-bacon-pork-industry-antibiotics-ib.pdf">18.4 million pounds in agriculture</a> compared to <a href="https://assets.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/better-bacon-pork-industry-antibiotics-ib.pdf">7.0 million pounds in human medicine</a>. Regardless, antibiotic use leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance">antibiotic resistance</a>. This externality should be priced at “between 29 and 287€ per kilogram active substance or between 9 and 86% of the average price of commonly used antibiotics” <span class="citation" data-cites="vaagsholm2010">(Vågsholm and Höjgård <a href="#ref-vaagsholm2010">2010</a>)</span>. Using the <a href="https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd/USD-to-EUR-2010">2010 exchange rate EUR/USD exchange rate of 0.75</a> and adjusting for <a href="http://www.in2013dollars.com/2010-dollars-in-2018?amount=1">inflation</a>, we find that this works out to $20–$201/lb of active substance. Picking the middle of the range produces the estimate of $110/lb used in the top table. The total cost calculated is in broad agreement with the estimated national cost of between $100 million and $30 million reported in <span class="citation" data-cites="rudholm2002economic">(Rudholm <a href="#ref-rudholm2002economic">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="debt">Debt</h1>
<p>Somewhat non-obviously, borrowing also has external costs. “A borrower who has one more dollar of liquid net worth when the economy experiences a bust relaxes not only his private borrowing constraint but also the borrowing constraints of all other insiders. Not internalizing this spillover effect, the insider takes on too much debt during good times.” <span class="citation" data-cites="jeanne2010managing">(Jeanne and Korinek <a href="#ref-jeanne2010managing">2010</a>)</span></p>
<p>On a percentage basis, this externality is small and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyclical_and_countercyclical_variables">procyclical</a>—0.56 percent of outstanding debt for small and medium enterprises in a boom and 0.48 percent of outstanding debt for households in a boom <span class="citation" data-cites="jeanne2010managing">(Jeanne and Korinek <a href="#ref-jeanne2010managing">2010</a>)</span>. It only amounts to a sizable cost because the quantities of debt involved are so enormous. American households took on <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html">$556 billion of new debt in the year up through Q3 of 2018</a>. SME outstanding debt totaled 5.34 trillion in 2009 <span class="citation" data-cites="jeanne2010managing">(Jeanne and Korinek <a href="#ref-jeanne2010managing">2010</a>)</span> (I couldn’t find info on the current rate of SME debt increase.).</p>
<h1 id="guns">Guns</h1>
<p>I couldn’t find any direct estimates of the externalities of firearms so I threw together my own estimate. The key number I sought was the number of accidental firearm killings of another person. I ruled out self-killings as internalities (Which is not strictly correct. If a child accidentally kills themselves with their parent’s gun, that’s an externality.). I ruled out intentional killings on the grounds that some unknown fraction of these would still occur even in the absence of guns. Clearly though, the resulting estimate is a conceptual lower bound.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="xu2016deaths">(Xu et al. <a href="#ref-xu2016deaths">2016</a>)</span> records 505 deaths from accidental discharge. <span class="citation" data-cites="hemenway2010unintentional">(Hemenway, Barber, and Miller <a href="#ref-hemenway2010unintentional">2010</a>)</span> reports that in half of such fatalities, the victim was shot by another person.</p>
<p>In 2016, 16 million guns entered circulation in the U.S. (base on <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/215395/number-of-total-firearms-manufactured-in-the-us/">11.5 million</a> manufactured in the U.S., <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/215562/number-of-exported-firearms-manufactured-in-the-us/">376 thousand</a> exported and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/215644/number-of-imported-firearms-into-the-us-by-country/">5.1 million</a> imported).</p>
<p>Using an even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life#United_States">$9 million</a> as the value of a statistical life, we find that the estimated cost of 252 deaths is around $2.26 billion. We divide by the 16 million guns entering circulation to get $134 per gun sale as an order of magnitude estimate of the appropriate Pigouvian tax.</p>
<h1 id="soda">Soda</h1>
<p>Even though the soda tax is a ‘popular’ policy, I couldn’t find any serious attempts to estimate the optimal Pigouvian tax for soda. Any attempt would be complicated by the fact that the marginal cost of soda consumption varies widely but systematically across consumers <span class="citation" data-cites="fleischer2015curb">(Fleischer <a href="#ref-fleischer2015curb">2015</a>)</span>—it would be much higher for those at risk of type 2 diabetes, for example.</p>
<h1 id="gambling">Gambling</h1>
<p>The three categories of external costs highlighted in <span class="citation" data-cites="clotfelter2005gambling">(Clotfelter <a href="#ref-clotfelter2005gambling">2005</a>)</span> are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Problem gamblers</dt>
<dd>Problems gamblers constitute ~2% of the adult population. They “driving themselves into bankruptcy, their families into hardship, and their personal relationships into ruin”. Their are inevitably social costs which accompany these problems.
</dd>
<dt>Undermines government credibility</dt>
<dd>“Government, through its schools, laws, and public pronouncements, advocates certain beliefs, including the value of productive work. To the extent that the sponsorship and, particularly, the promotion of gambling undercut that traditional message, legalized gambling creates a second category of external costs.”
</dd>
<dt>Organized crime</dt>
<dd>Lotteries don’t seem to do much to encourage organized crime but other forms of legalized gambling may.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="finance">Finance</h1>
<p>The three categories of external costs highlighted in <span class="citation" data-cites="masur2015">(Masur and Posner <a href="#ref-masur2015">2015</a>)</span> are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Speculation</dt>
<dd>“A transfer of money does not generate social value unless it is part of a transaction that reduces risk or otherwise enables people to spread receipts of money across times or states of the world in a way that advances their interests.”
</dd>
<dt>Races</dt>
<dd>“When new information about [current] events […] comes into existence, market participants will scramble to be the first to trade on the information. […] This activity is socially wasteful. […] [T]he broader market will not benefit at all if information about terrorism, as embodied in market prices, reaches them a nanosecond quicker than it otherwise does.”
</dd>
<dt>Debt</dt>
<dd>“Short-term debt creates a negative externality. When a depositor or other short-term lender withdraws money, it increases the probability that the borrower will not have enough funds to pay other lenders when the loans are due or demanded. Those lenders will not be able to recover in full because of bankruptcy.”

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paris and other French cities have recently been the site of large and heated (there were fires) protests. The most prominent symbol of the protests is the high-visibility <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement"><abbr title="yellow vests"><em>gilets jaunes</em></abbr></a> which all French motorists are required to own. This symbol is fitting for a series of protests that coalesced in opposition to an increase in the gas tax. While this protest (and any other protest) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/world/europe/france-fuel-carbon-tax.html">isn’t about a single grievance</a>, it certainly seems to signify something about the popular opinion of gas taxes.</p>
<p>These protests pair <span class="noted">somewhat uncomfortably</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> with the popular <a href="https://www.independent.ie/world-news/thousands-march-in-paris-against-climate-change-37296183.html">march against climate change in Paris</a> just three months ago.</p>
<p>This pattern seems common: Acknowledgment that global warming and excessive fossil fuel use are problems which must be addressed followed by reluctance or opposition to concrete responses <span class="citation" data-cites="leiserowitz2006climate">(Leiserowitz <a href="#ref-leiserowitz2006climate">2006</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>(Carbon taxes aren’t always doomed to failure. British Columbia has had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_carbon_tax">a carbon tax of $35 per tonne</a> in place since 2008. Sweden has the world’s highest <a href="https://www.government.se/government-policy/taxes-and-tariffs/swedens-carbon-tax/">carbon tax at about $138 per tonne</a>. California recently voted down <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_6,_Voter_Approval_for_Future_Gas_and_Vehicle_Taxes_and_2017_Tax_Repeal_Initiative_(2018)">a repeal of recent gas tax increases</a>.)</p>
<h1 id="pigouvian-taxes">Pigouvian taxes</h1>
<h2 id="what-are-pigouvian-taxes">What are Pigouvian taxes?</h2>
<p>So gas and carbon taxes are controversial with the public. Not so for economists and technocrats. They are both examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigouvian_tax">Pigouvian taxes</a>. In brief, Pigouvian taxes seek to correct market failures arising from negative externalities. A negative externality is any cost generated by a market activity that is not priced into the market exchange.</p>
<p>For example, local air pollution caused by combustion of gasoline harms other nearby people—think especially of those who don’t even own a car—who receive nothing in exchange for bearing this harm. Because these costs aren’t included in the price of gasoline, gas is cheaper than it ought to be, all things considered. This leads to overconsumption of gasoline.</p>
<p>A Pigouvian tax tries to remedy this market failure by making the ‘invisible’ costs of externalities manifest via a tax. If the total external costs of driving—due to externalities like greenhouse warming, congestion and local pollution—amount to $1.76 per gallon (an estimate from <span class="citation" data-cites="parry2007">(Parry, Walls, and Harrington <a href="#ref-parry2007">2007</a>)</span>), a tax of $1.76 on each gallon forces the gasoline purchaser to ‘internalize’ those costs—account for the social harm they are creating with their actions.</p>
<h2 id="a-tax-only-an-economist-could-love">A tax only an economist could love</h2>
<p>“Economists are in almost universal agreement that, in concept, pollution taxes are the most cost-effective means of reducing pollution” <span class="citation" data-cites="hsu2009psychological">(Hsu <a href="#ref-hsu2009psychological">2009</a>)</span>. In a direct survey, 65% of economists attested that there should be an overall increase in energy taxes <span class="citation" data-cites="whaples2006economists">(Whaples <a href="#ref-whaples2006economists">2006</a>)</span>. Gregory Mankiw keeps a partial list of prominent economists that support Pigouvian taxes in the form of the <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/09/rogoff-joins-pigou-club.html">membership rolls of the Pigou Club</a>.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, only 5% of the general public supported a tax on driving in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118304470725951593">a 2007 survey</a>.</p>
<p>For a (very accessible) fuller discussion in support of Pigouvian taxes from an economist, see <span class="citation" data-cites="mankiw2009">(Mankiw <a href="#ref-mankiw2009">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="reasons-to-oppose">Reasons to oppose</h1>
<p>I’ll confess myself to be on the side of economists when it comes to Pigouvian taxes. I’m then left with the question, why are they so unpopular with the general public? There are many possible reasons which we’ll now rehearse (Though we will stick to arguments where there’s something interesting to say about Pigouvian taxes specifically; we won’t rehash arguments about whether the government should ever intervene in the market, can be trusted, &amp;c.) . Since the case for Pigouvian taxes rests on both positive (these are the effects of Pigouvian taxes) and normative (these effects are good) premises, <span class="noted">we’ll categorize</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> the objections as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Misapprehensions of the positive</li>
<li>Disagreements with the positive</li>
<li>Misapprehensions of the normative</li>
<li>Disagreements with the normative</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="positive-misapprehensions">Positive misapprehensions</h2>
<h3 id="visible-costs-hidden-benefits">Visible costs, hidden benefits</h3>
<p>When a new Pigouvian tax is instituted, the costs it imposes are certain and immediate. The promised benefits only dangle from the end of a causal chain (i.e. tax → increased cost → reduced consumption → benefit). This compares unfavorably to direct regulations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_average_fuel_economy">CAFE</a> where the benefits are obvious and the costs are hidden. It takes more deliberate and careful analysis to reverse first impressions and come to the conclusion that, all things considered, Pigouvian tax A is preferable to regulation B (a conclusion economists reach much more often than the public). <span class="citation" data-cites="barthold1994issues">(Barthold <a href="#ref-barthold1994issues">1994</a>)</span></p>
<h3 id="metric-effect">Metric effect</h3>
<p>Gas taxes are usually proposed in terms of currency per volume—e.g. cents per gallon. <span class="noted">Apparently</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, people tend to overweight these kinds of taxes in comparison to taxes presented in percentage terms. So this works against gas taxes. <span class="citation" data-cites="hsu2009psychological">(Hsu <a href="#ref-hsu2009psychological">2009</a>)</span></p>
<h3 id="isolation-effect">Isolation effect</h3>
<p>Gas taxes are relatively complicated. The isolation effect says that in complicated decision scenarios, people will focus on a single dominant aspect and neglect other considerations. With gas taxes, the dominant consideration may be the cost of buying gas since this a common, salient experience for many. The other benefits then will be relatively neglected and overall evaluations of the gas tax will be imbalanced. <span class="citation" data-cites="hsu2009psychological">(Hsu <a href="#ref-hsu2009psychological">2009</a>)</span></p>
<h3 id="distributional-impact">Distributional impact</h3>
<p>The biggest concern by far (according to my sense of the public discussion) is about the distributional impacts. It’s often believed that gas taxes (and other Pigouvian taxes) are unfair and regressive. The story is that poor people spend a larger fraction of their income on gas, so increasing the gas tax flatly (i.e. without regard to income) ends up taxing poor people at a higher percentage of their income. There are several possible responses to this:</p>
<h4 id="flat-denial">Flat denial</h4>
<p>The regressive argument looks at incomes. But income is only part of the story. Arguably, <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=36">actual individual consumption</a> is a better measure <span class="citation" data-cites="fitoussi2009report">(Fitoussi, Sen, and Stiglitz <a href="#ref-fitoussi2009report">2009</a>)</span>. The total value of people’s consumption is determined not only by their private incomes but also by the assistance they receive from the government and non-profits. If we account for this additional income analogue, “low-expenditure households devote a smaller share of their budget to gasoline than do their counterparts in the middle of the expenditure distribution” <span class="citation" data-cites="poterba1991gasoline">(Poterba <a href="#ref-poterba1991gasoline">1991</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="less-regressive-than-alternatives">Less regressive than alternatives</h4>
<p>If we treat the amount of revenue to be raised as fixed (a mildly reasonable assumption), then the question changes from “Is a gasoline tax regressive?” to “Is a gasoline tax more regressive than alternative sources of funding?”. Is it more regressive than a progressive income tax? Probably. Is it more regressive than a flat sales tax? Usually not. So a shift to a gas tax from a sales tax—a common revenue-neutral proposal—is actually progressive.</p>
<h4 id="depends-on-how-revenue-is-spent">Depends on how revenue is spent</h4>
<p>If the revenue raised by a gas tax is spent on, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit">low-income tax credits</a> or increasing funding for public transit, it can easily be made progressive. “Lump-sum rebates are […] much more progressive, benefiting the three lower income quintiles even when ignoring environmental benefits” <span class="citation" data-cites="williams2014initial">(Williams et al. <a href="#ref-williams2014initial">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="distribution-of-benefits">Distribution of benefits</h4>
<p>The externalities that Pigouvian taxes seek to reduce don’t have equal incidence across the income spectrum. For example, low-income people likely work jobs which are less flexible making them more sensitive to unpredictable congestion during commutes <span class="citation" data-cites="arnott1994welfare">(Arnott, De Palma, and Lindsey <a href="#ref-arnott1994welfare">1994</a>)</span>. They also have reduced ability to choose housing in areas with good air quality. Consideration of factors like these mean that the benefits may accrue disproportionately to the poor which could make the overall scheme progressive even if the tax itself is regressive.</p>
<h4 id="concluding-remarks-on-distributional-impacts">Concluding remarks on distributional impacts</h4>
<p>If you’re still concerned, <span class="citation" data-cites="schweitzer2009empirical">(Schweitzer <a href="#ref-schweitzer2009empirical">2009</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="metcalf1999distributional">(Metcalf <a href="#ref-metcalf1999distributional">1999</a>)</span> address the issues fairly comprehensively.</p>
<p>I’ll also note here that the gas tax the <em>gilets jaunes</em> opposed was not revenue neutral—the revenue was to be used to reduce the deficit. So it was actually regressive at the most straightforward level.</p>
<p>Even though concerns about the distributional impact are primarily normative, I categorize this issue under positive misapprehensions because that’s where the error lies. People aren’t wrong to be concerned about the distributional impacts of policy; they just happen to be wrong as to how (at least some) gas taxes affect different income groups.</p>
<h2 id="positive-disagreements">Positive disagreements</h2>
<h3 id="non-uniform-marginal-cost">Non-uniform marginal cost</h3>
<p>Carbon taxes are essentially an ideal case for Pigouvian tax because the harm being done is the degradation of a global common resource. This means that the marginal social cost of any additional carbon is nearly constant so a flat, uniform tax closely aligns with costs. On the other hand, a Pigouvian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugary_drink_tax">tax on soda</a> would be difficult to implement well because the social cost of consumption varies widely with the consumer—nothing at all for those who are healthy and much higher for those who are likely to rely on socialized health care to remediate unhealthy eating. (If we really want to be obnoxious, we can call these Pigouvian taxes which apply a uniform tax despite varying marginal harms as Procrustean Pigouvian taxes.) This consideration only limits the scope of Pigouvian taxes though; it does nothing to argue against the efficacy of Pigouvian taxes that are applied in fitting circumstances. <span class="citation" data-cites="fleischer2015curb">(Fleischer <a href="#ref-fleischer2015curb">2015</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="normative-misapprehensions">Normative misapprehensions</h2>
<h3 id="status-quo-bias"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias">Status quo bias</a></h3>
<p>Many people already drive and have established expectations about the benefits and costs of doing so. An increased gas tax increases the costs of present activities while providing new and uncertain benefits. Because people overvalue the present state of affairs, this factor tends to oppose the gas tax. (<span class="citation" data-cites="hsu2009psychological">(Hsu <a href="#ref-hsu2009psychological">2009</a>)</span> points to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a> but it strikes me as a bit weird to call the habit of driving a possession.)</p>
<p>(I call this a misapprehension due to my belief that no popular moral theory endorses stasis as an intrinsic good. Presumably, people could be cajoled into overcoming this bias by coming to a fuller understanding of themselves, their preferences, and alternative states of the world.)</p>
<h2 id="normative-disagreements">Normative disagreements</h2>
<h3 id="doing-vs.allowing-harm"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/">Doing vs. allowing harm</a></h3>
<p>Imposing a gas tax seems to proactively harm intensive consumers and current producers while the less-taxed status quo seems to harm only by accident. People generally seem to find allowing harm preferable to doing harm. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect">doctrine of double effect</a> and people’s reluctance to redirect the trolley in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a>. (<span class="citation" data-cites="hsu2009psychological">(Hsu <a href="#ref-hsu2009psychological">2009</a>)</span> talks about this as a psychological bias called the do-no-harm effect.)</p>
<h3 id="moral-circle">Moral circle</h3>
<p>The costs and benefits of a Pigouvian tax are not always evenly spread. <span class="noted">We see some of this dynamic</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> in the foot-dragging of the United States in regards to global warming. A flat global carbon tax would be more costly for Americans as the average American produces <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC">16.5 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> annually</a> compared to the global average of 5.0 tonnes. Additionally, the US is likely to suffer less from global warming than other countries because of its climate and wealth. If Americans look only to the costs and benefits for themselves and their fellow citizens, they may be perfectly rational (in a particular narrow sense) in rejecting carbon taxes and other global warming mitigations. <span class="noted">A similar dynamic plays out any time some egocentric subgroup is harmed more by a Pigouvian tax than helped by reduced externalities.</span><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="discount-rate-and-population-ethics">Discount rate and population ethics</h3>
<p>Some of the harms which a Pigouvian tax would avert peak decades in the future. A carbon tax, for example, would be paid now with the biggest benefits coming decades in the future. In those cases, an individual would pay a cost now for benefits they’d reap far in the future, if it all. If their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_discount_rate">discount rate</a> is high or if they value present persons more than potential future persons <span class="citation" data-cites="parfit1984reasons">(Parfit <a href="#ref-parfit1984reasons">1984</a>)</span>, it would be fully rational (again, in a particular sense) for them to disfavor the tax.</p>

<p>Some societies actively encourage children to be aggressive, not only to each other but even to the parents.

Similar behavior is described for the Gapun of Papua New Guinea; even raising a knife to an older sibling is rewarded. Yanomamö boys of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Amazon are encouraged to be aggressive and are rarely punished for hitting either their parents or the girls in the village.</p>

<p>The exchange of goods between far-flung <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trobriand_Islands">islands</a> is essential, for some of the islands are small and rocky and cannot produce enough food to sustain their inhabitants, who specialize instead in canoe building, pottery making, and other crafts. Other islanders produce far more yams, taro, and pigs than they need. However, the practical side of the trade is hidden beneath a complex ceremonial exchange, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kula_ring">kula ring</a>, an exchange of valued shell ornaments across a set of far-flung islands.</p>
<p>Two kinds of ornaments are involved in the ceremonial exchanges—white shell armbands (mwali), which are given only in a counterclockwise direction, and red shell necklaces (soulava), which are given only in a clockwise direction. The possession of one or more of these ornaments allows a man to organize an expedition to the home of one of his trading partners on another island.</p>

In working among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelam_people">Abelam</a> of New Guinea, Richard Scaglion was puzzled why they invest so much energy in growing giant ceremonial yams, sometimes more than 10 feet long. Additionally, why do they abstain from sex for six months while they grow them? Of course, to try to understand, we need to know much more about the Abelam way of life. Scaglion had read about them, lived among them, and talked to them, but, as many ethnographers have discovered, answers to why questions don’t just leap out at you. Answers, at least tentative ones, often come from theoretical orientations that suggest how or where to look for answers. Scaglion considers several possibilities. As Donald Tuzin had suggested for a nearby group, the Plains Arapesh, yams may be symbols of, or stand for, shared cultural understandings. (Looking for the meanings of symbols is a kind of interpretative approach to ethnographic data.) The Abelam think of yams as having souls that appreciate tranquility. Yams also have family lines; at marriage, the joining of family lines is symbolized by planting different yam lines in the same garden. During the yam-growing cycle (remember that yams appreciate tranquility), lethal warfare and conflict become channeled mostly into competitive but nonlethal yam-growing contests. So yam growing may be functional in the sense that it helps to foster harmony.

The groom is determined to display his virility; the bride is equally determined to test it. “Brides,” Robert and Barbara LeVine remarked, “are said to take pride in the length of time they can hold off their mates.” Men can also win acclaim. If the bride is unable to walk the following day, the groom is considered a “real man.”
</blockquote>
<h2 id="on-sisterly-love">On sisterly love</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Wolf focused on a community still practicing the Chinese custom of t’ung-yang-hsi, or “daughter-in-law raised from childhood”:</p>
<blockquote>
When a girl is born in a poor family … she is often given away or sold when but a few weeks or months old, or one or two years old, to be the future wife of a son in the family of a friend or relative which has a little son not betrothed in marriage. … The girl is called a “little bride” and taken home and brought up in the family together with her future husband.
</blockquote>
<p>Wolf’s evidence indicates that this arrangement is associated with sexual difficulties when the childhood “couple” later marry. Informants implied that familiarity caused the couple to be disinterested and to fail to be stimulated by one another. Such couples produce fewer offspring than spouses who are not raised together, are more likely to seek extramarital sexual relationships, and are more likely to get divorced.</p>

<p>biological harm to offspring was mentioned in 50 percent of ethnographic reports. For example, Raymond Firth reporting on the Tikopia, who live on an island in the South Pacific, wrote:</p>

The idea is firmly held that unions of close kin bear with them their own doom, their mara. … The idea [mara] essentially concerns barrenness. … The peculiar barrenness of an incestuous union consists not in the absence of children, but in their illness or death, or some other mishap. … The idea that the offspring of a marriage between near kin are weakly and likely to die young is stoutly held by these natives and examples are adduced to prove it.

<blockquote>
<p>A common type of mutual aid society is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_savings_and_credit_association">rotating credit association</a>. The basic principle is that each member of the group agrees to make a regular contribution, in money or in kind, to a fund, which is then handed over to each member in rotation. The regular contributions promote savings by each member, but the lump sum distribution enables the recipient to do something significant with the money. These associations are found in many areas of East, South, and Southeast Asia, Africa (particularly West Africa), and the West Indies. They usually include a small number of people, perhaps between 10 and 30, so that rotations do not take that long.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In societies that depend on sharing, saving money is difficult. Others may ask you for money, and there may be an obligation to give it to them. However, if there is a rotating credit association, you can say that you are obliged to save for your contribution and people will understand. Rotating credit associations also appear to work well when people find it hard to delay gratification. The social pressure of the group appears sufficient to push people to save enough for their regular contribution,</p>

This is an important distinction because a social engineer can change the way conditional preferences manifest by changing the environment while unconditional preferences can only be altered in a direct confrontation.</p>
<p><abbr title="Norms in the Wild">NitW</abbr> also draws a distinction between prudential and moral preferences. I think these can be viewed as a special case of conditional and unconditional preferences. It seems we can gloss these to preferences which seek to satisfy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value">instrumental or intrinsic values</a>. Preferring not to cheat out of a fear of getting caught is a prudential preference; preferring not to cheat because it’s an odious breach of faith is a moral preference. This distinction is important because moral preferences are typically more stable—prudential preferences may change with changing circumstances while moral preferences will not.</p>

<h1 id="collective-behavior"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="collective" class="arg-map">Collective behavior</a></h1>
<p>With those distinctions made, we can start to suss out the varieties of collective behavior. <abbr title="Norms in the Wild">NitW</abbr> suggests something like the following overview:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/norm-diagnosis.svg" alt="Diagnostic process of identifying collective behaviors" id="diagnosis-diagram" /><figcaption>Diagnostic process of identifying collective behaviors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We’ll start from the bottom. There are three different types of collective behavior identified here:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="custom" class="arg-map">Custom</a></dt>
<dd>“a pattern of behavior such that individuals (unconditionally) prefer to conform to it because it meets their needs” <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="descriptive" class="arg-map">Descriptive norm</a></dt>
<dd>“a pattern of behavior such that individuals prefer to conform to it on condition that they believe that most people in their reference network conform to it (empirical expectation)” <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="norm" class="arg-map">Social norm</a></dt>
<dd>“a rule of behavior such that individuals prefer to conform to it on condition that they believe that (a) most people in their reference network conform to it (empirical expectation), and (b) that most people in their reference network believe they ought to conform to it (normative expectation)” <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the distinctions aren’t quite clear yet, hopefully walking through the diagnostic process will clarify. We start at the top of <a href="#diagnostic-diagram">the diagram</a> with an observed collective behavior.</p>
<h2 id="socially-conditional">Socially conditional</h2>
<p>Our first fork is about whether the behavior is conditional on social expectations–that is, do social expectations have causal influence. In other words, if our preferences are in the bottom right of <a href="#preferences-grid">the preferences grid above</a>—they’re socially conditional—we take the right of the fork. If they’re not socially conditional, we take the left side of the fork. If we’ve taken the left side of the fork, we don’t care to make any further distinction at present and just call all such collective behaviors <em>customs</em>. In these cases, we see many agents making similar choices because they are all acting out similar preferences in a similar environment; no communication is required. An example of a custom like this is (almost) everyone wearing a coat in cold weather—the fact that I expect others to also wear a coat is irrelevant to my decision.</p>
<h2 id="type-of-social-expectation">Type of social expectation</h2>
<p>When we took the left side of the first fork, we ended in customs. What happens if we take the right side of that initial fork? In that case, we’re affirming that social expectations have causal influence over the collective behavior.</p>
<p>The question that remains and constitutes the second fork is “What type of social expectations?”. If the only expectations that are a basis for the action are empirical, we call the collective behavior a <em>descriptive norm</em>. If both empirical and normative expectations are relevant, we call it a <em>social norm</em>. In terms of the <a href="#beliefs-grid">beliefs grid above</a>, we’ve already restricted ourselves to the right column by taking the right side of the first fork (“It’s socially conditional”) and now we’re determining whether we’re in the top right or bottom right.</p>
<p>Examples might help further clarify the distinction: - Everyone walking on the right side of a walkway is a descriptive norm. If you expect everyone else to act that way, you achieve your aims best by conforming. Violations are more likely met with eye-rolls than disapprobation. - Waiting your turn in line is (in many cultures) a social norm. Not only do others behave that way, but they believe that everyone ought to behave that way. Violations are likely to meet with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fight+cutting+in+line">sanctions</a>.</p>
<h1 id="measuring-norms">Measuring norms</h1>
<p>Phew. Done with all the conceptual analysis. Now we can start to try to apply this analysis in the world. If a social engineer wants to change a norm, their first step is to confirm that there is actually a norm in effect. This is a multistep process that will mostly follow <a href="#diagnosis-diagram">the diagram above</a>.</p>
<h2 id="collective-pattern-of-behavior">Collective pattern of behavior</h2>
<p>The first step is simply to confirm that there is indeed a collective pattern of behavior. Just because a social engineer thinks something is common practice, doesn’t mean it actually is—perceptions don’t always match reality. The practices part of a <a href="https://www.spring-nutrition.org/publications/tool-summaries/kap-survey-model-knowledge-attitudes-and-practices"><abbr title="Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices">KAP survey</a> is one common tool that can be used for this. This step is generally straightforward social science and doesn’t have any norm-related special sauce so we’ll move on.</p>
<h2 id="social-expectations">Social expectations</h2>
<p>The next step is to establish whether there are normative social expectations behind the collective pattern of behavior. To this end, a social engineer must measure the normative beliefs of the individuals in the relevant community.</p>
<p>Questionnaires are a fairly straightforward way to do this. Crucially, the survey should ask about each of personal normative beliefs (“Do you personally think female genital cutting is morally obligatory, permissible or forbidden?”), empirical social expectations (“How prevalent do you think female genital cutting is in your community?”), and normative social expectations (“What fraction of your community do you think believes that female genital cutting is morally obligatory? Permissible? Forbidden?”). We can actually go even further as outlined in the following table:</p>

<h3 id="pluralistic-ignorance"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="ignorance" class="arg-map">Pluralistic ignorance</a></h3>
<p>A social engineer needs to ask about personal normative beliefs and normative social expectations because these don’t always align. When each person (or most people) in a community falsely believes that others support a norm and their private disapproval is exceptional, we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance">pluralistic ignorance</a>. <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/norms-wild-clickbait#on-reluctant-female-genital-cutting">The table on female genital cutting</a>, for example, suggests a serious divergence between private beliefs and public professions due to pluralistic ignorance in countries like Djibouti and Somalia.</p>
<p>The distinction between norms which are the result of pluralistic ignorance and those which are the result of genuine community endorsement is, of course, an important one. We’ll talk more about the different strategies these scenarios demand shortly.</p>
<h3 id="methodological-tips-and-tricks">Methodological tips and tricks</h3>
<p>While the basic idea of questionnaires is straightforward, there are several subtleties that apply in this domain.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Disinterest</dt>
<dd>People may simply try to complete the questionnaire as quickly as possible and, in doing so, give inaccurate responses. This problem can <span class="noted">sometimes</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> be ameliorated with monetary incentives—“If your answer about the prevalence of this moral belief in your community turns out to be correct, we’ll pay you a bonus.”. Unfortunately, monetary incentives like this can induce distortions of their own.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias">Social desirability bias</a></dt>
<dd>Social desirability bias is likely to be particularly important when surveying people about moral beliefs. To combat this, a social engineer can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response">randomized responses</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is by no means a complete list but does hint at the care which must be taken when designing questionnaires in the investigation of social norms.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-social-expectations">Conditional social expectations</h2>
<p><a href="#diagnosis-diagram">Our diagram</a> actually compresses things and elides an important distinction. “if they have social expectations” requires both that there are social expectations and that those expectations are causally relevant. In the previous measurement step, the social engineer confirmed that social expectations are present. But, because actions are multiply determined, this information alone isn’t enough to determine whether the social expectations are causally relevant. A collective pattern of behavior might actually be sustained by legal mandates or identical private moral beliefs or ignorance of alternatives (or etc.) with the social expectations incidental.</p>
<p>When I hear causal, I think counterfactual and when I hear counterfactual, I think experiment. However, outside the lab, it’s difficult to manipulate social expectations. The best option for assessing the counterfactual may be describing and asking about hypothetical scenarios.</p>
<p>Hypotheticals that contradict known fact are often difficult for people to answer. Thus, it’s usually better to use vignettes describing possible futures or fictional characters. Instead of “Would you still practice female genital cutting if your community opposed it?”, prefer “Would you still practice female genital cutting if you moved to a new community that opposed it?” or “Nkemdilim lives in a community similar to yours, but it does not approve of female genital cutting or sanction those that refrain from it. Should she still participate in female genital cutting?”.</p>
<p>While hypotheticals like this are imperfect—people probably have difficulty imaginatively transposing themselves and “forgetting” their current perspective entirely—they do offer our best clues. If people suggest changed behavior in response to hypotheticals which alter social expectations, that’s good evidence the collective behavior is indeed conditional on social expectations—that the expectations are causally relevant. Hypotheticals also allow us to suss out under which conditions the norm applies and which expectations are most important for the maintenance of the norm.</p>
<h1 id="changing-norms">Changing norms</h1>
<p>Let’s recap for a moment. We started out with a conceptual analysis of social norms and related concepts. Then we looked into how a social engineer could apply these concepts in the real world via measurement. If the hypothesis was correct, measurements confirm that the social engineer is dealing with a social norm—a collective behavior that’s conditional on empirical and normative social expectations.</p>
<p>Now, we get to the part that justifies (at least my) interest in all this: the possibility of changing norms. <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span> outlines four components of norm change:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“[P]eople must face a collective action problem”</li>
<li>“[T]hey must have shared reasons to change”</li>
<li>“[T]heir social expectations must collectively change”</li>
<li>“[T]heir actions have to be coordinated”</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll tackle these in order.</p>
<h2 id="problem"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="persistence" class="arg-map">Problem</a></h2>
<p>A harmful (from the social engineer’s perspective) norm may persist for one of many reasons <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="preferred" class="arg-map">“People may not see the current norm as problematic, and even if presented with alternatives, they may defend their ways as superior.”</a></li>
<li><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="alternatives" class="arg-map">“A second reason why a norm may not seem problematic is the lack of knowledge of possible alternatives”</a></li>
<li>Pluralistic ignorance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shared-reasons"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="reasons" class="arg-map">Shared reasons</a></h2>
<p>Because of each of the above problem scenarios has distinct implications, we’ll consider them separately when walking through the shared reasons part of norm change.</p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="norm-problem">
<div class="open">
<p>The most challenging circumstances for the social engineer are when a community actively prefers the current norm to alternatives. In this case, the social engineer must undertake a campaign of persuasion. Of course, neither the original book nor this summary can cover this topic comprehensively. That said, here’s a first look at that topic:</p>
<h3 id="targets-of-persuasion">Targets of persuasion</h3>
<p>It’s often prohibitively difficult to convince a community to abandon a norm entirely. Norms are often the outgrowth of deeply held moral beliefs; convincing someone to abandon their core moral beliefs is both difficult and (hopefully) unnecessary. Imagine someone trying to convince you to abandon your belief that wanton killing is wrong—they’d have a hard time of it. Instead, a social engineer can take advantage of the multiplicity of norms and interpretations of norms.</p>
<p>Defiance of an undesirable norm can be <a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="prioritize" class="arg-map">grounded in adherence to some alternative norm</a>. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franca_Viola">Franca Viola</a> case involved giving the norm of protecting your child priority over the norm of honor:</p>
<blockquote>
People who abide by honor norms also hold norms of protective parenting. In the 1960s, Sicily was a place where honor norms held strong. For example, a girl who was raped was expected to marry her rapist to preserve her family’s honor. In the well-known case of Franca Viola, this expectation was completely reframed. She was raped but refused to marry her rapist, and her unusual decision was supported by her father, who put caring for and protecting his child above the powerful norm of honor. By appealing to this other norm, he was able to justifiably defy honor norms. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>Another option is to <a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="reinterpret" class="arg-map">change the way a moral ideal is manifested</a> in practice while leaving the ideal itself untouched. For example, the saleema campaign reframed uncut girls as intact and pure whereas the old interpretation had been that cut girls were chaste and pure:</p>
<blockquote>
The word saleema means whole, intact, healthy, and perfect. It conveys the idea that being uncut is the natural, pristine state. Radio and video campaigns linked traditional values of honor and purity to the idea that uncut girls are complete and pure. Media campaigns and community discussions were framed and organized around this positive message. Perceiving girls through the “Saleema lens” functionally disconfirmed the belief that uncut girls are not chaste and pure. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>In either case, these approaches make the social engineer’s task easier. They must simply make some existing beliefs more salient rather than attempting to destroy existing norms entirely and create new ones whole cloth.</p>
<h3 id="theories-of-persuasion"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="theories" class="arg-map">Theories of persuasion</a></h3>
<p>We can theorize the task of persuasion as changing people’s underlying <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">schemata</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_script">scripts</a></em>. Schemata are patterns of thought that organize information and the relationships among pieces of information. Scripts are schemata applied to events and behavior—scripts are sequences of expected actions linked to particular circumstances (the response in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus%E2%80%93response_model">stimulus-response</a>, if you will).</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span> outline’s three theories of script and schema change:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bookkeeping model</dt>
<dd>A schema is altered when people encounter a sufficient quantity of moderately schema-discrepant observations.
</dd>
<dt>Conversion model</dt>
<dd>A schema is suddenly altered when someone encounters a few, highly schema-discrepant observations.
</dd>
<dt>Subtyping model</dt>
<dd>Core schemata are never altered. Schema-discrepant observations are accommodated by creating subcategories to house “exceptions”.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I haven’t yet actually investigated these models of schema revision in any detail. But further investigation would hopefully help one craft more persuasive pitches for norm change.</p>
<h3 id="techniques-of-persuasion">Techniques of persuasion</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance">positive deviance</a> approach, among other things, emphasizes that people are much more likely to be convinced that a behavior is effective by seeing successful individuals employing it rather than by simply being told it is effective. In other words, show, don’t tell. This suggests that finding exemplary allies in the community practicing a norm can be a key tactic for changing that norm.</p>
<p>Somewhat relatedly, empirical expectations seem to trump normative expectations. Way back in the <span id="diagnosis-diagram">diagram</span>, we specified that social norms typically rely on both normative expectations <em>and</em> empirical expectations. We both have beliefs about what others think we should do and about what others actually do. This opens up the possibility that the two types of expectations may conflict with each other. What happens in these cases—which type of expectation wins out and determines behavior? Evidence suggests that empirical expectations do.</p>
<p>For example, despite people’s abstract knowledge that they ‘should’ reduce power consumption, additional information about their neighbors’ actual power consumption produces significant change:</p>
<blockquote>
Allcott and Mullainathan (2010) report that American households who got mailers comparing their own electricity consumption to that of their neighbors reduced their consumption as much as they would have if the cost of power had risen by 11–20 percent. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example of the priority of empirical expectations is given in the section <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/norms-wild-clickbait/#on-dirty-laundry">on dirty laundry in another post on <em>Norms in the Wild</em></a>.</p>
<p>This suggests that harmful <a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="defiance" class="arg-map">norms can be undermined by highlighting existing non-compliance</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="expectation-change"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="expectation-change" class="arg-map">Expectation change</a></h2>
<p>Even if the above persuasion succeeds, that’s not enough. Individuals privately supporting an alternative norm doesn’t necessarily lead to changed behavior. The reason is that social norms, unlike customs and descriptive norms, are rarely self-enforcing.</p>
<p>By <em>self-enforcing</em>, we mean that individuals will follow some pattern of collective behavior even in the absence of any social response to their behavior. People don’t need social approval before putting on a coat in cold weather. Walking on the wrong side of the sidewalk would be self-defeating because you’d get to your destination slower due to the need to dodge everyone walking against you. On the other hand, an unscrupulous person might cut in line every time they thought they could get away with it. The near absence of line cutting (in certain cultures) is maintained only through continuous <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fight+cutting+in+line">social sanctions for norm violators</a>.</p>
<p>Because social norms are socially enforced, unilateral defiance is rarely advantageous. It’s only when social expectations collectively change that changed behavior becomes possible. All of this means that attempts to advocate for alternative collective behaviors must be broadly effective before any change will be visible—there’s a threshold. But even convincing a majority of people that some alternative is preferable isn’t enough.</p>
<p>The social engineer must convince each person in a community of three things: 1. An alternative norm is superior (accomplishing this is covered in the <a href="#shared-reasons">shared reasons</a> section) 2. Other people in the community support an alternative norm 3. Other people in the community are also convinced of the above</p>
<p>If the social engineer succeeds only at the first two, each individual will still be afraid to defy the existing norm. <span class="noted">For example, even if Fiorenzo believes that others in his community privately dislike some norm, if he thinks they believe the norm still has public support, he’ll think they’ll still enforce the norm and sanction him for violating it</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The necessity of <span class="noted">common knowledge</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> means that public fora are quite useful. When people discuss norms, their concerns, and their changing attitudes with other members of their community, it becomes possible for people to “infer that others’ beliefs are changing alongside their own” <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="collective-action"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="collective-action" class="arg-map">Collective action</a></h2>
<p>We’re almost there. In the first three steps, the social engineer identified why a problematic norm persists, convinced people privately that an alternative is superior, and then made people’s preferences for change common knowledge. The final step is to realize these common preferences and enact a new norm.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t easy; it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">problem of collective action</a>. The core issue is that individual incentives can diverge from group incentives. For example, cutting in line is advantageous for any individual if not punished. But if every individual tries to cut, the outcome is worse for everyone than adhering to the no cutting norm.</p>
<p>This echoes back to the discussion on social norms not being self-enforcing. Just as a social engineer wanted to eliminate social sanction for defying a bad norm, they may want to introduce social sanction for defying a good norm. This is one way to solve collective action problems.</p>
<p>Sanctions aren’t the only way to solve collective action problems. There are other opportunities too, but the literature on collective action is deep and we won’t cover any more of it here. I hope to address it more directly in a future post.</p>
<h1 id="tools"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="tools" class="arg-map">Tools</a></h1>
<p>That last section is the last of the core content in <em>Norms in the Wild</em>. This last section will just cover some tools it outlines as potentially useful for a social engineer.</p>
<h2 id="economic"><a href="#yaas-social-norms-map" id="economic" class="arg-map">Economic</a></h2>
<p>One obvious option for changing norms (in particular, providing shared reasons for change) is altering economic incentives. However, this approach has several limitations:</p>
<ul>

<p>Alternatively, one could simply try to mandate adherence to a new norm with the force of law. This should provide strong shared reasons to change. However, “if a new legal norm imposes harsh penalties against an accepted social norm, police will be less likely to enforce the legal norm, prosecutors will be less likely to charge, and juries to convict, with the effect of ultimately reinforcing the social norm that was intended to be changed.” <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The efficacy of legal mandates for changing norms is strongly correlated with trust in formal institutions.</p>

<p><em>Trendsetters</em> may be useful for both providing reasons to change and altering shared expectations. As previously mentioned, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance">positive deviance</a> approach suggests that lived demonstrations by one trendsetter may be worth a thousand exhortations from a social engineer. Additionally, if a trendsetter is not sanctioned or only sanctioned lightly, this may change observers expectations about the cost of their own defiance.</p>
<p>Trendsetters are likely to be:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Risk-insensitive</dt>
<dd>They may not much care about the possibility of sanction
</dd>
<dt>Misperceive the risks of deviance</dt>
<dd>They may underestimate the likelihood or magnitude of sanction.

<dd>They may not have much esteem for the norm and what it represents

<p>Finally, edutainment is, reportedly, <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/norms-wild-clickbait/#on-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-tv">shockingly effective at changing norms</a>.</p>
<p>Edutainment may be effective for some combination of the following reasons:</p>

<h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>
<h2 id="narrative">Narrative</h2>
<p>Suppose you’re voting on increased funding for the local library. You don’t personally use the library much, but you figure that others in the polity are reliant on the library. Out of a sense of solidarity you vote for increased funding even though, from a purely egocentric perspective, this reduces your welfare (i.e. the increased cost outweighs your private benefit). When results come in, the library funding measure passes in a landslide and you bask in your altruism.</p>
<p>Alas, the voting results are no guarantee that you’ve <em>actually</em> acted altruistically. It’s entirely possible that you misunderstood the preferences of others and that the polity has made a decision that’s net harmful.</p>
<h2 id="numerical">Numerical</h2>
<p>For generality, we’ll call voting for increased library funding option <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and voting against (the status quo) option <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>

<p>The table outlines a scenario in which each of three voters (it’s a small polity) prefers option <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Unfortunately, they’ve each come to the inaccurate belief that each other voter prefers option <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. That is voter A slightly prefers <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> but believes voter B and voter C each slightly prefer <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>If our voters are good utilitarians in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">first-past-the-post</a> system, they’ll all vote for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(1 + 1 - 1 &gt; 0 + 0 + 0\)</span>) and it will win. The resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function">social welfare</a> will be <span class="math inline">\(-3 = 3 \cdot -1\)</span>. If our voters had voted in a purely egocentric manner—ignoring the preferences of others, they would each pick <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and the social welfare would have been <span class="math inline">\(0 = 3 \cdot 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is pretty perverse—our voters have selected the social welfare minimizing option despite their scrupulous motives and they would have better achieved their altruistic ends by voting selfishly!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
<p>What’s going on here? The problem arises from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism_theory_of_voting">social preferences</a>—second-order preferences about the preference satisfaction of others. In order to incorporate the preferences of others, altruistic voters must (usually implicitly) aggregate them. In other words, it as though altruistic voters are <span class="noted">running their own internal voting system and then voting according to the outcome of that vote</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The public, explicit voting system then takes these outputs and aggregates them again. So in any election with altruistic voters, there are really two levels of aggregation happening—the internal aggregations of altruistic voters in which they try to ascertain which option is best for the polity and the external aggregation involving ballots that we usually think of.</p>
<p>The other key ingredient for our perverse outcome is inaccurate beliefs about the preferences of others. If every voter knew precisely the preferences of every other voter and performed a perfect, utilitarian aggregation, they’d all vote the same way and there would be no problem. This, of course, never actually happens. Imperfect information is pervasive.</p>
<p>To recap: When voters have social preferences and imperfect information, they have to work harder (they must perform internal aggregation) and can achieve worse outcomes than if they simply voted egocentrically.</p>
<h1 id="relevance">Relevance</h1>
<p>Is all this theorizing just idle fun? Or does this problem arise in practice? I can’t say for sure, but here are some indications.</p>
<p>People probably do have social preferences. One argument in favor of this claim is theoretical: it’s only rational to vote if you have social preferences <span class="citation" data-cites="edlin2007">(Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan <a href="#ref-edlin2007">2007</a>)</span>. People do vote and we like to pretend they’re rational, so they must have social preferences. The other argument is more directly empirical. In as survey of 2000 Danes, “29.4% voted for a party they did not believe was best for themselves” <span class="citation" data-cites="mahler2017">(Mahler <a href="#ref-mahler2017">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It strikes me as almost certain that voters often have incorrect information about other voters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance">Pluralistic ignorance</a> is a similar phenomenon that’s known to exist. See, for example, <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/norms-wild-clickbait#on-reluctant-female-genital-cutting">the table on divergent support and prevalence of female genital cutting</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest uncertainty is whether the inaccurate beliefs are of the shape required to produce perverse outcomes. For example, in our initial scenario, if each voter had believed that each other voter only valued <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> at 0.1 instead of 1, they would have voted for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and maximized social welfare (<span class="math inline">\(0.1 + 0.1 - 1 &lt; 0\)</span>). Or, two voters could have erroneously thought that everyone else dislikes libraries which would have canceled out the overestimate of the third voters and coincidentally produced the right outcomes.</p>
<h1 id="escape">Escape</h1>
<p>Is there any way to lift the curse?</p>
<h2 id="stop-being-altruistic">Stop being altruistic</h2>
<p>One proposal is simply for everyone to vote egocentrically (again, this means they ignore their social preferences and just vote according to their private values). But in a <abbr title="first-past-the-post">FPTP</abbr> system, this is a cure that may well be worse than the disease. While it avoids the perverse outcome in the scenario outlined above, strict adherence ensures <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/innocuous-invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies/">invidious majoritarian tyrannies</a>—the minor preferences of the many outweigh the major preferences of the few.</p>
<p>But it’s not quite fair to attribute that problem to social preferences when it’s more the fault of a lamentable voting system. Egocentric voting with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting">score voting</a> system would avoid both the altruist’s curse and invidious majoritarian tyrannies.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished_speech">Hang the banner and board the aircraft carrier</a>. Right?</p>
<p>Alas, the problem is not quite solved. Throughout, we have been supposing that the social preferences are strictly utilitarian. As long as the voting system is also formulated on a utilitarian basis like score voting, altruistic voters can simply “delegate” their aggregation to the external aggregation system (i.e. the polity’s actual voting system) and vote egocentrically. This works because their internal aggregation algorithm would precisely match the external aggregation algorithm—the voting system already embodies their second-order preferences.</p>
<p>But most voters aren’t strictly utilitarian. They may have other sorts of social preferences. Since they can’t rely on the external aggregation mechanism, voters with non-utilitarian social preferences would again be forced to perform internal aggregation in an attempt to better express both their first-order (egocentric) and second-order (social) preferences. As long as different individuals have different types of social preferences (some utilitarian, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism">prioritarian</a>, etc.), no voting system can assure all voters that their interests are best served by a simple egocentric vote. Similar ideas are explored in more depth and rigor (in a somewhat different setting) are explored in <span class="citation" data-cites="jehiel2001">(Jehiel and Moldovanu <a href="#ref-jehiel2001">2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="be-a-more-effective-altruist">Be a more effective altruist</h2>
<p>It appears we can’t lift the curse by just ceasing to be altruistic and ignoring our social preferences. The other key cause of the curse we identified was imperfect information. I think there’s room for improvement here. Currently, there are polls <em>ad nauseam</em> in the run-up to any election. But the information these polls contain is usually about the way that people will vote, not about their private preferences. As we’ve examined, people’s votes are not identical with their private preferences. If we use the information about voting intentions as a proxy for their private preferences when deciding our votes, we’re getting systematically biased information. If pollsters also asked about and published egocentric preferences along with voting intentions, we’d have a much better foundation on which to ground our opinions and votes.</p>

<p><em>Norms in the Wild</em> emphasizes that would-be reformers must understand not only local conditions (physical facts) but also local understandings (beliefs about those facts and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">schema</a>). It illustrates the point with this vivid example:</p>
<blockquote>
For example, Yoder (1995) demonstrated that local Zairian understandings of the nature, causes, and appropriate treatment of childhood diarrhea differed considerably from the contemporary biomedical approach. <strong>What most Westerners would consider a case of diarrhea could be classified as one of six different diseases by residents of Lubumbashi, Zaire</strong>, depending on the perceived symptoms of the sufferer. All of the diseases feature frequent stools as one of their central symptoms, but only Kauhara (one of the local terms for a type of diarrhea) was functionally equated with what a medical practitioner would diagnose as diarrhea. Other diarrheal classifications, such as <strong>Lukunga, which featured a “clacking sound” in the mouth as a critical symptom (in addition to frequent stools)</strong>, was not equated with the typical medical diagnosis. When various organizations tried to inform Zairians about appropriate treatments for diarrhea, many locals likely interpreted the information to be only specific to Kauhara (and not other local disease classifications). In line with this assertion, the sampled Zairians in Yoder’s (1995) study readily *<strong>gave the appropriate treatment (e.g., oral rehydration therapy) to their children if they were thought to have Kahuara but not if they were thought to have another diarrheal disease.</strong> <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2016">(Bicchieri <a href="#ref-bicchieri2016">2016</a>)</span></span>

In some such interventions, facilitators will lead groups of people through the heart of open defecation fields, effectively triggering collective feelings of disgust and embarrassment. Later the <strong>facilitators will place feces next to food, and point out how flies will flit back and forth between them</strong>, effectively simulating the disease transmission process. Through this example, food that is left out near feces is linked with feelings of disgust. <strong>The facilitator can also smear her hands with clay or charcoal, wipe them on a leaf (simulating having fecal matter on one’s hands even after wiping them “clean”), and shake hands with members of the community</strong>.

    <updated>2018-10-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The “amateur” part isn’t an entirely false modesty. I am indeed often summarizing works in areas where I have limited experience and I’m certainly not paid for it. As such, despite my best efforts, I will assuredly sometimes mangle the subject matter. Once we both acknowledge this, we’re left with the question: Why bother to read or write these summaries?</p>
<h1 id="for-you">For you</h1>
<p>I can think of a few reasons you might like to read these summaries despite those limitations:</p>
<h2 id="curse-of-expertise">Curse of expertise</h2>
<p>Experts <span class="noted">may</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> be worse at explaining material than intermediate practitioners due to heuristics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">anchoring</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="hinds1999">(Hinds <a href="#ref-hinds1999">1999</a>)</span>. Anecdotally, it seems like professors who know the material <em>too</em> well to explain it are a common experience. As someone who has just learned the material I’m summarizing, I may be well-positioned to explain it.</p>
<h2 id="length">Length</h2>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/">perennial</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/book">popularity</a> of <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">summarizers</a> <a href="https://joosr.com/our-books">attests</a>, there’s an audience for condensed versions of books. Existing summarizers seem to target self-help and management books though. I, on the other hand, expect to target a more niche and academic set of books. I’ll somewhat cheekily summarize that as: If it’s ever been on a best-seller list, don’t expect to see it here.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>Another reason you might prefer these summaries to the originals is their inimitable, insouciant style. In all seriousness, academic writing is a genre with conventions that aren’t optimal for all purposes. While the writing here might sometimes seem a pitiable mockery of academic style, the academese here is an accident rather than a necessity. I’m very open to better conventions and will try to adopt them as I come upon them.</p>
<h2 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h2>
<p>I sometimes create novel, <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/tag/interactive/">interactive</a> content to explain material. The feedback that interactivity can provide is pretty handy for learning <span class="citation" data-cites="hattie2007">(Hattie and Timperley <a href="#ref-hattie2007">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="generalist">Generalist</h2>
<p>I strive to be a generalist. That means I may make connections to areas the source material doesn’t. If you and I happen to share more reference points than you and the original author do, we may communicate better.</p>
<h1 id="for-me">For me</h1>
<p>But I’ll not pretend to be entirely unselfish here. A large part of my motivation for these summaries is to improve my own understanding. That is, I hope to use these summaries as an opportunity to construct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">schema</a> and use the imagination effect <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span> to combat the illusion of explanatory depth <span class="citation" data-cites="rozenblit2002">(Rozenblit and Keil <a href="#ref-rozenblit2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>

</menu>
<p>Epistemology is the study of <a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="knowledge" class="arg-map">knowledge</a>.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-knowledge"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="what" class="arg-map">What is knowledge?</a></h1>
<p>For literally millenia, people were content to think of knowledge as justified true belief <span class="citation" data-cites="plato360">(Plato <a href="#ref-plato360">360BC</a>)</span>. Let’s break that down briefly:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Belief</dt>
<dd>A belief is mental content held as true. Thinking to myself, with conviction, “I am a human.” and “I am a dragon.” are each equally examples of beliefs.
</dd>
<dt>True</dt>
<dd>Alas, only one of the above claims is true. Even if I have very convincing hallucinations of breathing fire and flying, “I am a dragon” is merely justified belief. It’s not true and so not knowledge.
</dd>
<dt>Justified</dt>
<dd>On the other hand, if I stumble onto true belief, it still doesn’t count as knowledge. If you roll a 100-sided die and hide the result under a cup, I don’t <em>know</em> that the result is 64 even if I believe it and it turns out to be true—I have no justification for the belief.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It’s only when beliefs are both true <em>and</em> justified that they count as knowledge. Sounds reasonable, right?</p>
<h2 id="gettier-problem"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="gettier" class="arg-map">Gettier problem</a></h2>
<p>Not to Edmund Gettier. In a three page paper <span class="citation" data-cites="gettier1963">(Gettier <a href="#ref-gettier1963">1963</a>)</span>, he presented two compelling counterexamples to this analysis. An example of this vein of anecdote is:</p>
<p>Whetu is driving home from work one day and happens to see her coworker Sigrún in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2_(T3)">Vanagon</a>. She thinks to herself, “Ah, one of my coworkers owns a Vanagon.” However, unbeknownst to Whetu, Sigrún does not actually own the Vanagon she was driving—she was in the midst of stealing it. But, coincidentally, one of Whetu’s other coworkers <em>does</em> own a Vanagon.</p>
<p>So Whetu’s initial belief—“One of my coworkers owns a Vanagon”—turns out to be true and justified (we’ll count seeing someone driving a car as convincing justification for believing that they own it). But intuitively, we’re reluctant to accept that Whetu knows that one of her coworkers owns a Vanagon. It seems like she just got lucky—her mistaken justification was rescued by a fact that she would be surprised to learn.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This set off a frenzy of philosophical activity that has yet to cease <span class="citation" data-cites="shope2017">(Shope <a href="#ref-shope2017">2017</a>)</span>. Most philosophers try to repair the traditional analysis by finding some appropriate link between justification and truth. If Whetu just got lucky, we need to ensure that luck doesn’t suffice to constitute knowledge. For reasons of brevity (among others), I’ll direct the interested to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/">SEP</a> for a further discussion of the reams of argumentation here.</p>
<h2 id="justification"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="justified" class="arg-map">Justification</a></h2>
<p>Let’s circle back to justification and look at it more closely.</p>
<h3 id="münchhausen-trilemma"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="munch" class="arg-map">Münchhausen trilemma</a></h3>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="just-explain">
<div class="open">
<p>Suppose you’re with an inquisitive, relentless, precocious, philosophically convenient child in the park. They turn to you and ask:</p>
<div class="conversation">
<p>“What shape is that cloud?”</p>
<p>“Square.”</p>
<p>“Why do you believe that?”</p>
<p>“Because I see it with my eyes.”</p>
<p>“Why do you believe your eyes?”</p>
<p>“Because they’ve historically been reliable.”</p>
<p>“Why do you believe your eyes have historically been reliable?”</p>
</div>
<p>Now, we have a choice.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="infinit" class="arg-map">Infinitism</a></dt>
<dd><p>It seems clear that we may well face an endless stream of “why”s. We can choose to accept this and generate an endless series of responses, to the best of our ability:</p>
<div class="conversation">
<p>“Why do you believe your eyes have historically been reliable?”</p>
<p>“Because last time I believed that my eyes were reliable, I met with success.”</p>
<p>“Why did you believe that your eyes were reliable last time?”</p>
<p>&quot;Because the time before that, I believed my eyes were reliable and met with success.</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p>Endorsing infinite chains of justification characterizes <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/inf-epis/">infinitism</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="found" class="arg-map">Foundationalism</a></dt>
<dd><p>Alternatively, we can try to stem the stream of “why”s. One way is bare assertion:</p>
<div class="conversation">
<p>“Why do you believe your eyes have historically been reliable?”</p>
<p>“Because they agree with my other senses and my other senses have historically been reliable.”</p>
<p>“Why do you believe your other senses are reliable?”</p>
<p>“I just do. I have to have some kernel beyond doubt.”</p>
</div>
<p>Endorsing justification by some set of basic beliefs which are themselves justified without reference to other beliefs characterizes <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/">foundationalism</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="coherent" class="arg-map">Coherentism</a></dt>
<dd><p>Finally, we can try to avoid an infinite stream of “why”s by justifying one belief with another belief we’ve already justified:</p>
<div class="conversation">
<p>“Why do you believe your eyes have historically been reliable?”</p>
<p>“Because they agree with my other senses and my other senses have historically been reliable.”</p>
<p>“Why do you believe your other senses have historically been reliable?”</p>
<p>“Because they agree with my eyes and my eyes have historically been reliable.”</p>
</div>
<p>Endorsing cyclic justification—we justify sight with reference to other senses and other senses with reference to sight— characterizes <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/">coherentism</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, to summarize, when faced with endless ’why’s, we can pursue one of three strategies: Provide an endless stream of responses, declare that some beliefs are above questioning, or provide circular justification. Again, there’s lots of arguments about which (if any) of these positions is correct which we’ll not cover here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="internalism-v.-externalism"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="internal-external" class="arg-map">Internalism v. externalism</a></h3>
<p>All this talk about the structure of justification probably raises the question: What <em>is</em> justification? There’s surprisingly little agreement. Philosophers have staked out some views though.</p>
<p>One key disagreement is between <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/int-ext/">externalist and internalist accounts of justification</a>. Internalists hold that all the features relevant for justification are “internal” to a person. Externalists hold that factors “outside” of an individual can also be relevant to the question of whether that person’s belief is justified. Internal factors are things like beliefs and other mental content we can access upon reflection. External factors are things like the process by which we arrived at those beliefs—we often don’t recall or know the mechanism by which we arrived at some arbitrary belief.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you believe that your aunt is in the same province as you. You believe this because you believe that she’s on a vacation there. You believe your aunt is on a vacation to your province because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot#Occult_tarot_decks">tarot deck</a> said so. An internalist is closer to being obliged to call the original belief (about your aunt being in the same province) justified because the structure of beliefs—internal mental content—in the immediate vicinity is proper. An externalist has additional grounds on which they can reject this as valid justification—they can object that a tarot deck is not a reliable method for forming beliefs and so not a firm ground for justification. The internalist, on the other hand, can make no appeals to the (un)reliability of tarot cards because it’s a claim about the world at large, not the internal mental state of the believer.</p>
<p>Yet again, there’s lots of argument on both sides of this debate. We can’t possibly do it justice here. It is interesting to note though that a solid plurality of surveyed philosophers favored externalism <span class="citation" data-cites="bourget2014">(Bourget and Chalmers <a href="#ref-bourget2014">2014</a>)</span>:</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-of-induction"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="induction" class="arg-map">The problem of induction</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">Induction</a> (not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">mathematical sort</a>) is about generalizing from particulars to generalities not logically entailed by those particulars. For example, I’ve seen a dozen black crows in a dozen different places and on this basis conclude that all crows are black.</p>
<p>We perform this sort of operation all the time but on what warrant? Our (often implicit) belief in the validity of induction relies on what we’ll call the uniformity principle:</p>
<blockquote>
instances, of which we have had no experience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the course of nature continues always uniformly the same. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="hume1739">(Hume <a href="#ref-hume1739">1739</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>But <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/">how can we justify belief in such a proposition</a>? It does not seem to be a logical inevitability. And on the other hand, it doesn’t seem that any finite set of empirical observations elevates it above doubt. Even if the laws of physics have applied uniformly over the past century, that’s little guarantee that they’ll proceed on placidly forevermore. Any attempt to generalize particular instantiations of the uniformity principle into a universal affirmation of the uniformity principle would <em>itself</em> rely on the uniformity principle.</p>
<h3 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="priori-posteriori" class="arg-map"><em>A priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em></a></h3>
<p>A proposition is justified <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/"><em>a priori</em></a> if it is <span class="noted">justified without reference to any sense experience</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. If the justification relies on sense experience, a proposition is justified <em>a posteriori</em>.</p>
<p>For example, our belief in the proposition “All bachelors are unmarried.” isn’t contingent on any particular sense experience. Even if I’d lived my whole life apart from human society and had never seen any other humans—bachelor or otherwise—I’d readily assent to the proposition as soon as I understood the terms involved.</p>
<p>Conversely, the proposition “It’s chilly outside.” is intimately connected to sense experience. It is sometimes true and sometimes false and which case obtains ultimately depends on sense data. If I go outside and feel the cool air on my skin, it may well change my disbelief to belief.</p>
<p>Should we care about this distinction or is its continued regurgitation just ritual genuflection before our lord and savior Immanuel Kant? I make no definite claims on the matter here, but I do hope that the distinction seem a bit more interesting in light of the next section.</p>
<h2 id="belief"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="belief" class="arg-map">Belief</a></h2>
<p>Closely related to the notions of <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> justification are <span class="noted">the notions of necessary and contingent propositions, and analytic and synthetic propositions</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. All were addressed prominently in <span class="citation" data-cites="kant1781">(Kant <a href="#ref-kant1781">1781</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="necessary-and-contingent"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="modal" class="arg-map">Necessary and contingent</a></h3>
<p>A proposition is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modality-varieties/">necessarily true</a> if its negation is impossible or contradictory. That is, the proposition is true in all <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/">possible worlds</a>. Conversely, a proposition is contingently true if being both true without contradiction and false without contradiction. That is, the proposition is true in some possible worlds and false in others.</p>
<p>For example, the proposition “All bachelors are unmarried.” is necessarily true. Given a fixed meaning for the terms, there is no possible world in which the proposition is false. On the other hand, “It’s chilly outside.” is true in some possible worlds and false in others—it is contingent.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the following claims come as no surprise to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contingent propositions are closely related to <em>a posteriori</em> justification. If a proposition is true in some possible worlds and false in others, we quite plausibly have need of our senses to determine which possible world we actually inhabit and, correspondingly, whether the proposition in question is true or false.</li>
<li>Necessary propositions are closely related to <em>a priori</em> justification. If a proposition is true in all possible worlds, the task of determining which world we actually inhabit is otiose when it comes to determining the truth of the proposition. Since we don’t care which world we actually inhabit, our sense experience is irrelevant to the task at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, the relationship between these categories isn’t actually as straightforward as all that. There’s ongoing disagreement about the precise nature of the relationship. In fact, there’s not even universal acknowledgment that <em>a priori</em> knowledge exists <span class="citation" data-cites="bourget2014">(Bourget and Chalmers <a href="#ref-bourget2014">2014</a>)</span>:</p>

<h3 id="analytic-and-synthetic"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="ana-synth" class="arg-map">Analytic and synthetic</a></h3>
<p>The final Kantian distinction is between <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/">analytic and synthetic propositions</a>. An analytic proposition is one whose meaning is true in light of the meaning its terms. A synthetic proposition is one whose meaning is true in light of the correspondence between its meaning and the world. “All bachelors are unmarried.” is an analytic proposition and “It’s chilly outside.” is a synthetic proposition.</p>
<p>Hopefully, that distinction is fairly straightforward at this point (If not, you can always follow the link above.). With it out of the way, we can move on to talk about a slightly more complex taxonomy:</p>

<p>There’s general philosophical agreement that analytic propositions with <em>a priori</em> justification exist, that synthetic propositions with <em>a posteriori</em> justification exist, and that analytic propositions with <em>a posteriori</em> justification don’t exist. The most controversial intersection then is between <em>a priori</em> and synthetic. On one view, this is what the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/">rationalism v. empiricism</a> debate is about—rationalists hold that synthetic <em>a priori</em> knowledge is possible while empiricists deny it.</p>

<h2 id="truth"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="true" class="arg-map">Truth</a></h2>
<p>Your patience for these persnickety philosophers likely begins to grow thin. They cavil and niggle, carp and quibble. They’ve taken common sense notions like knowledge, belief and justification, raised questions, drawn distinctions and offered precious little in the way of answers. But at last, you think, we come to truth—a concept so straightforward it’s beyond the grasping claws of even the most wretched sophist. Alas…</p>
<p>Philosophers advance myriad interpretations of truth. These can be categorized under a few broad headings:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="correspondence" class="arg-map">Correspondence</a></dt>
<dd><p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/">Correspondence theories of truth</a> are probably closest to common sense, folk theories of truth. They said that a proposition is true if and only if it corresponds to the world—if the map corresponds to the territory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="epistemic" class="arg-map">Epistemic</a></dt>
<dd><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_theories_of_truth">Epistemic theories of truth</a> are a heterogeneous lot. The common element is that they all suggest that the truth of a proposition depends on our beliefs. For example, the <span class="noted"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/">coherence theory of truth</a></span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> holds that a proposition is true in light of coherence with other propositions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="deflationary" class="arg-map">Deflationary</a></dt>
<dd><p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-deflationary/">Deflationary theories of truth</a> are a bit hard to succinctly explain. We’ll just say that, like it says on the tin, they try to take the magic out of ‘truth’ and get by with a minimal notion.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here too, the debate is unresolved <span class="citation" data-cites="bourget2014">(Bourget and Chalmers <a href="#ref-bourget2014">2014</a>)</span>:</p>

<h2 id="skepticism"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="skeptics" class="arg-map">Skepticism</a></h2>
<p>When we presented the <a href="#münchhausen-trilemma">Münchhausen trilemma</a>, we actually omitted one possible response. We said that justifying knowledge ultimately required coherentism, foundationalism, or infinitism. The fourth option is to deny the possibility of knowledge altogether. Without any knowledge at all, nothing stands in need of justification and the whole problem is neatly avoided. Denying the possibility of knowledge characterizes <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/">skepticism</a>.</p>
<p>One thought experiment that generates an intuition for skepticism is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument">the dream argument</a>: When we dream, we usually don’t know we’re dreaming. How do we know we’re not dreaming now? How can we have complete certainty that our perceptual experiences relate to the real, physical world rather than a dream world?</p>
<h2 id="fallibilism"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="fallibilists" class="arg-map">Fallibilism</a></h2>
<p>In some ways, <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/fallibil/">fallibilism</a> is the softer cousin of skepticism. Like skepticism, it denies that we can ever make claims with absolute conviction; we can never be certain we know the truth. Unlike skepticism, it is content to call fallibly justified beliefs—which may turn out to be false—knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="epistemism"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="epistemists" class="arg-map">Epistemism</a></h2>
<p>Epistemism doesn’t seem to be a term in common use, but, for the sake of completeness, we’ll use it to describe the position that says we can have certain knowledge.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-decline-and-rise-of-long-term-memory">The decline and rise of long-term memory</h1>
<p>I used to scorn long-term memory. My brain is an exquisite organ for vanquishing conundra, thank you very much, not some library card catalog. I assume I assimilated this attitude from <span class="noted">discussion like</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>But, after reading up on pedagogy in articles like <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/human-cognitive-architecture-learning">the one we discussed earlier</a>, “[I] no longer see longterm memory as a repository of isolated, unrelated facts that are occasionally stored and retrieved; instead, it is the central structure of human cognitive architecture.” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span></p>
<h1 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h1>
<p>Thus, I present my own entry in the burgeoning <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">subgenre</a> of <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition software</a> <a href="http://devonzuegel.com/post/thoughts-on-spaced-repetition">encomia</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> software optimally schedules flashcard review to radically boost retention of information in long-term memory. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is one such program. I’d heard of Anki in the past but only managed to acquire the habit of regular review more recently. I’ve performed a total of 14306 reviews of 3811 cards during review sessions and reviewed on 58 of the last 58 days (Let it never be said that I do things in half measures.). This is probably too intense and more than I’d recommend for most people. But that information should serve to calibrate you as to how much experience I have with Anki.</p>
<h2 id="the-feel-of-a-thing">The feel of a thing</h2>
<p>The dominant feeling I now have is a mild frustration at the betrayal of present me by past me—so much of my prior reading and general intellectual development was wasted effort. If we each had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a> and forgot 100% of what we’d read or otherwise experienced, we’d surely take a different approach to life. We wouldn’t just wander along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)">learning and forgetting in an endless cycle</a>. But the truth of our memories is not so far off!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
A modern example of this loss of knowledge without repetition is a study of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills that demonstrated rapid decay in the year following training. <strong>By 3 years post-training only 2.4% were able to perform CPR successfully</strong>. <strong>Another recent study</strong> of physicians taking a tutorial they rated as very good or excellent showed mean knowledge scores increasing from 50% before the tutorial to 76% immediately afterward. However, score gains were only half as great 3–8 days later and incredibly, <strong>there was no significant knowledge retention measurable at all at 55 days</strong>. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="stahl2010">(Stahl et al. <a href="#ref-stahl2010">2010</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>These feelings of loss and waste are confirmed by my Anki bootstrapping process. Recently, I’ve been rereading and Ankifying (more on what this means later) books I’ve read over the past several years. Even for topics which I had found interesting and important, review reveals that vast gobs of information I once knew have been lost to the sands of time.</p>
<p>And what was lost isn’t mere trivia—“If it’s important, you’ll remember it.” is a wish for a more congenial world, not a description of ours. The things which I had forgotten but now review in Anki come up in thoughts, conversations, and other readings daily. Academics sometimes extol “the life of the mind”. If this is something you value, I very much recommend Anki. It is one of the better things I’ve done in this regard—certainly one of the most tangible and transferable in that my recommendation can be straightforwardly adopted by others.</p>
<h2 id="anki-and-cognitive-load-theory">Anki and cognitive load theory</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Nielsen">Michael Nielsen</a> <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">talks about using Anki</a> to understand a difficult paper on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I began with the AlphaGo paper itself. <strong>I began reading it quickly, almost skimming.</strong> I wasn’t looking for a comprehensive understanding. Rather, I was doing two things. One, I was trying to simply identify the most important ideas in the paper. What were the names of the key techniques I’d need to learn about? Second, there was a kind of hoovering process, <strong>looking for basic facts that I could understand easily</strong>, and that would obviously benefit me. Things like basic terminology, the rules of Go, and so on.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><strong>I made several rapid passes over the paper in this way</strong>, each time getting deeper and deeper. At this stage I wasn’t trying to obtain anything like a complete understanding of AlphaGo. Rather, I was trying to build up my background understanding. At all times, <strong>if something wasn’t easy to understand, I didn’t worry about it, I just keep [sic] going</strong>. But as I made repeat passes, <strong>the range of things that were easy to understand grew and grew</strong>. I found myself adding questions about the types of features used as inputs to AlphaGo’s neural networks, basic facts about the structure of the networks, and so on.</p>
<p>After five or six such passes over the paper, <strong>I went back and attempted a thorough read</strong>. This time the purpose was to understand AlphaGo in detail. By now I understood much of the background context, and <strong>it was relatively easy to do a thorough read, certainly far easier than coming into the paper cold</strong>. Don’t get me wrong: it was still challenging. But it was far easier than it would have been otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in perfect accord with our <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/human-cognitive-architecture-learning">earlier post on cognitive load theory</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>When element interactivity is very high, it may be impossible for learners to understand the material</strong> because it may be impossible for them to simultaneously process all of the interacting elements in working memory. How should such material be presented? From a cognitive load theory perspective, <strong>the only way seems to be to initially present the material as individual elements ignoring their interactions</strong>. This procedure will permit the elements to be learned but without understanding. Once the individual elements have been learned, their interactions can be emphasized. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span></span>

<h2 id="how-i-anki">How I Anki</h2>
<p>This isn’t meant to be an exhaustive tutorial; there are already many of those.</p>
<ul>
<li>I read on an eBook reader and highlight seemingly important snippets as I go.</li>
<li>I then transfer these snippets to the computer and make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">cloze deletions</a>.</li>
<li>I can use the number of Anki cards created as a measure of progress. It can be discouraging to spend hours reading and only cover a few pages. The number of new cards created in the process is both a reminder of a progress and a way to pace myself. If I limit Anki to only show 40 new cards a day, having created 40 new cards is a strong signal that I ought to switch tasks and pursue something else for the rest of the day.</li>
<li>Almost all of my cards are cloze deletions. Cloze deletion cards are convenient to create and very general. For example, “bidirectional” terminology cards (i.e. it’s useful to be able to recall the word when cued by the definition and to be able to recall the definition when cued by the word) can be created quickly by creating one deletion around the term and one around its definition.</li>
<li>I’ll <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules">echo</a> the advice to avoid sets (an unordered collection of items such that the memory cue for each item is inconstant) in favor of enumerations (an ordered collection of items such that the memory cue for each item is constant).</li>
<li>On the other hand, be careful with the <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules">“minimum information principle”</a>. Creating cards with many small deletions can leave too much inappropriate context. For example, a card like, “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion">Taiping rebellion</a> lasted from <em>1850</em> to <em>1864</em>”, with one cloze deletion for each year is troublesome. I’ve found that I’m quite likely to remember only the relationship between the numbers in these circumstances. When cued with “1850”, I’ll think “14 years later” and remember “1864”. When cued with “1864”, I’ll think “14 years earlier” and remember “1850”. But if I try to remember the actual dates outside of Anki, I’m left without an anchor. Making these deletions “correlated”—so that the years are both omitted simultaneously—seems to work better.</li>
<li>Somewhat relatedly, it’s useful to minimize the number of “orphans”. An isolated fact or a collection of facts is not only less useful because it’s less accessible (i.e. not readily found from other pieces of knowledge and invoked in thought) but also harder to remember. Organizing cognitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">schema</a> generally make learning and retention easier. To this end, I sometimes informally envision my collection of Anki cards as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a> and try to ensure that all cards are reachable from as few roots as possible. This promotes a cohesive, coherent understanding of the material under review rather than a disjointed, disorienting one.</li>

<p>“The meteorite itself was so massive that it didn’t notice any atmosphere whatsoever,” said Rebolledo. “It was traveling 20 to 40 kilometers per second, 10 kilometers — probably 14 kilometers — wide, pushing the atmosphere and building such incredible pressure that the ocean in front of it just went away.”</p>
<p>These numbers are precise without usefully conveying the scale of the calamity. What they mean is that a rock larger than Mount Everest hit planet Earth traveling twenty times faster than a bullet. This is so fast that it would have traversed the distance from the cruising altitude of a 747 to the ground in 0.3 seconds. The asteroid itself was so large that, even at the moment of impact, the top of it might have still towered more than a mile above the cruising altitude of a 747. In its nearly instantaneous descent, it compressed the air below it so violently that it briefly became several times hotter than the surface of the sun.</p>
<p>“The pressure of the atmosphere in front of the asteroid started excavating the crater before it even got there,” Rebolledo said. “Them when the meteorite touched ground zero, it was totally intact. It was so massive that the atmosphere didn’t even make a scratch on it.”</p>
<p>Unlike the typical Hollywood CGI depictions of asteroid impacts, where an extraterrestrial charcoal briquette gently smolders across the sky, in the Yucatan it would have been a pleasant day one second and the world was already over by the next. As the asteroid collided with the earth, in the sky above it where there should have been air, the rock had punched a hole of outer space vacuum in the atmosphere. As the heavens rushed in to close this hole, enormous volumes of earth were expelled into orbit and beyond — all within a second or two of impact.</p>
<p>“So there’s probably little bits of dinosaur bone up on the moon,” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, probably.”</p>

<blockquote>
The shortest-lived child of Prohibition actually survived to adulthood. This was the change in drinking patterns that depressed the level of consumption compared with the pre-Prohibition years. Straitened family finances during the Depression of course kept the annual per capita consumption rate low, hovering around 1.5 US gallons. The true results of Prohibition’s success in socializing Americans in temperate habits became apparent during World War II, when the federal government turned a more cordial face toward the liquor industry than it had during World War I, and they became even more evident during the prosperous years that followed.50 Although annual consumption rose, to about 2 gallons per capita in the 1950s and 2.4 gallons in the 1960s, it did not surpass the pre-Prohibition peak until the early 1970s.

A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic. <span class="attribution">—Probably not Joseph Stalin</span>

<p>We humans are famously bad at finely-tuned and well-calibrated caring. In an early study on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect">scope neglect</a>, experimental subjects were willing to pay $80 to save 2,000 migrating birds from drowning in oil ponds and $78 to save 20,000 <span class="citation" data-cites="desvousges1992">(Desvousges et al. <a href="#ref-desvousges1992">1992</a>)</span>. Alas, our sentiments are not a precision instrument.</p>
<p>But suppose that our moods better mapped to the world as we understand it:</p>
<p>Whatever betrayal you feel watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubt_(2008_film)">Doubt</a>, the betrayal would feel more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/us/catholic-church-sex-abuse-pennsylvania.html">300 times as sharp</a>. 300 abusers represents just Pennsylvania. The full tally is unknown and probably unknowable.</p>
<p>Whatever loss you feel watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)">Up</a>, you’d be struck by it again and again for each of the approximately 80,000 miscarriages per day across the world <span class="citation" data-cites="american2002">(Obstetricians, Gynecologists, and others <a href="#ref-american2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Whatever despondency you feel watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone">Winter’s Bone</a>, your feelings would be magnified in depth and breadth by the knowledge that 836 million people in the world live on less than $1.25/day <span class="citation" data-cites="un2015">(UN <a href="#ref-un2015">2015</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Whatever loneliness you feel watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Colours:_Blue">Three Colors: Blue</a>, you might feel that same feeling <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2010/12/29/baby-boomers-retire/">2,500 times a day</a> for each of the one quarter of US women who are widowed by age 65 <span class="citation" data-cites="berardo1992">(Berardo <a href="#ref-berardo1992">1992</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Whatever horror you feel watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Algiers">The Battle of Algiers</a>, you’d feel it just the same for each and every one of the approximately 80,000 people who will die from battle in state-based conflicts this year <span class="citation" data-cites="owidwarandpeace">(Roser <a href="#ref-owidwarandpeace">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Whatever impotence you feel watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_of_Sheep">Killer of Sheep</a>, you’d remember that there are <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/losangelescountycalifornia/PST045217">over 900,000 black people in Los Angeles alone</a> living under flawed structures and institutions.</p>

<p>The tragedies of life on Earth are no recent revelation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a>—our earliest surviving great work of literature—is about the hero’s vain attempt to undo the great tragedy of his life.</p>
<p>For some, the knowledge that tragedy has been with us from the beginning inspires not acquiescence but determination that we might leave it behind before we reach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe">the end</a>. These are names that go down in history. Names like:</p>

<dd><p>“The exposure of sick, weak, deformed children, in short their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject, and indeed at any price, and yet takes the life of a hundred thousand healthy children in consequence of birth control or through abortions, in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses.”</p>
</dd>
<dt>Charles Trevelyan</dt>
<dd><p>In the face of the catastrophic Irish famine: “If the Irish once find out that there are any circumstances in which they can get free government grants, we shall have a system of mendicancy such as the world never knew.”</p>

<dt>George W. Bush</dt>
<dd><p>“In many nations of the Middle East – countries of great strategic importance – democracy has not yet taken root. And the questions arise: Are the peoples of the Middle East somehow beyond the reach of liberty? Are millions of men and women and children condemned by history or culture to live in despotism? Are they alone never to know freedom, and never even to have a choice in the matter? I, for one, do not believe it.”</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pol Pot</dt>
<dd><p>“I came to join the revolution, not to kill the Cambodian people. Look at me now. Am I a violent person? No. So, as far as my conscience and my mission were concerned, there was no problem.”</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whoops. That list wasn’t quite the moment of triumph we were building to.</p>
<p>I include all these names on the list not to suggest that they are morally equivalent but to illustrate a common thread: In each case, someone had or claimed to have a vision of the world as it ought to be—a remedy for misery. They swept up others, opportunists and true believers, in their vision. When they tried to wrench the world as they understood it toward the world as they imagined it, they found that these notional worlds were neither the world as it was nor the world as it should be. The distance between the notional and the actual was measured in bodies. In brief, the problem was hubris writ large.</p>
<h1 id="maximize-or-be-maximized">Maximize or be maximized</h1>
<blockquote>
This war is not as in the past; whoever occupies a territory also imposes on it his own social system. Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can reach. It cannot be otherwise. If now there is not a communist government in Paris, this is only because Russia has no an army which can reach Paris in 1945. <span class="attribution">—Actually Joseph Stalin</span>
</blockquote>
<p>If hubris is the problem, is the answer simply to look at all the fables on hubris—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus">Icarus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaethon">Phaethon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost">Paradise Lost</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>—and follow the sage advice found therein? Alas, the complexity of the world as it is exceeds the complexity of the world as we render it in stories. There’s no author to ensure that our repentance is rewarded and we cannot relinquish power to its rightful source.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the only way out is through—we must maximize. As Stalin suggests in the epigraph, I fear that maximizers are destined to win out over satisficers. Just as a strain of bacteria which reproduces would dominate a petri dish when pitted against a sterile strain and a proselytizing religion spreads farther and faster than a disinterested one, totalizing world-systems tend to crowd out complacent ones. So whether the maximizer you fear is <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway">capitalism</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies">its claimed successor</a>, there is no refuge from maximizing.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The only possibility left to us is to enthrone a benevolent maximizer—usher in utopia—before one of the many indifferent maximizers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative">squeezes out all alternatives</a>. That is, we must find and reify the right epistemology, ethics, politics, economics, etc.—<a href="#the-world-as-we-understand-it">the world as we understand it forbids stasis</a>. And there are no half measures in sight—it’s <a href="#maximize-or-be-maximized">maximize or be maximized</a>. But we must undertake this task with full knowledge that it is doubtful and dangerous—<a href="#the-world-as-we-imagine-it">the world is better and worse and more than we imagine it to be</a>.</p>
<div class="skippable">
<h1 id="long-form-caveats">Long-form caveats</h1>
<p>In addition to the shorter ‘Warnings’ up top:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Inevitably, <a href="#the-world-as-we-understand-it">The world as we understand it</a> cannot represent all the ills of the world. Any selection of problems is incomplete and no particular instance of a problem as dramatized in a film can represent the whole class. The current list has many omissions which reflect limited data, time, and my own parochialism.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not a wholly credulous adherent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">great man theory</a> of history. The implied blame for the names listed in <a href="#the-world-as-we-imagine-it">The world as we imagine it</a> should surely be spread across many more actors.</p></li>
<li><p>The arguments presented for <a href="#maximize-or-be-maximized">Maximize or be maximized</a> are far from conclusive. I am not myself convinced the claim is correct. Even if it’s not, I think the moral imperative to maximize can be made (under certain ethical views) in terms of opportunity cost. Opportunity cost just doesn’t stir the heart in the same way that averting catastrophe does.</p></li>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference">principle of indifference</a> (a.k.a. the principle of insufficient reason) suggests that when considering a set of possibilities and there’s no known reason for granting special credence to one possibility, we ought to assign all possibilities the same credence (which, on the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/">Bayesian</a> point of view, is also a probability). For example, when someone asks what the result of a 6-sided die roll is, the principle of indifference recommends we assign a probability of 1/6 to each outcome. Slightly more interesting is that it <em>also</em> recommends assigning a probability of 1/6 to each outcome even when we’re told the die is weighted as long as we’re not told how it’s weighted.</p>
<p>There’s a definite intuitive plausibility and appeal to this rule. But it turns out there are a lot of difficulties when it comes to actually operationalizing it. Below, I list some of the problems that have been raised over the years. Some of these problems seem silly to me and will doubtless seem silly to you. Others strike me as important. I list them all here regardless and ignore any claimed solutions for the moment.</p>

<p>“What is the origin country of this unknown traveler? France, Ireland or Great Britain?”</p>
<p>Naive application of the principle of indifference (NAPI) suggests we assign probability 1/3 to each possibility.</p>
<p>The question can be rephrased: “What is the origin country of this unknown traveler? France, or the British Isles?”.</p>
<p>In this case, <abbr title="Naive application of the principle of indifference">NAPI</abbr> suggests we ought to assign a probability of 1/2 to each possibility.</p>
<p>So, depending on the framing, we assign probability 1/2 or 1/3 to the same outcome—the traveler is from France.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideal-theory">Ideal theory</h1>
<p>If I may editorialize, the ideal theory debate is essentially about how to translate our understanding of justice into actions in the present. Reductively, one side (the idealists) advocates for always moving the world we inhabit closer to the ideally just world while the other side (the non-idealists) advocates for always moving the world we inhabit toward the best adjacent world.</p>
<p>What’s not usually at issue in the ideal theory debate is: our understanding of the status quo, our predictive models of the future, or our notion of justice. That’s not to say that there’s consensus on these issues—far from it. It’s just that discussion of these issues doesn’t fall under the heading of ‘ideal theory’. No one considers themselves to be waging that debate when they talk about currently existing inequality in Germany or what justice recommends with regard to positive and negative rights. By all this I merely mean to emphasize that the scope of the ideal theory debate is rather small—given all the presuppositions above, what algorithm do we employ to choose the next possible world we’ll inhabit?</p>
<p>Hopefully, by framing the ideal theory debate in the foregoing terms, I’ve predisposed you to my point of view: The subject matter of the ideal theory debate is also the subject matter of decision theory. That is, the ideal theory debate is really a debate about applied decision theory.</p>
<h1 id="normative-decision-theory">Normative decision theory</h1>
<p><del><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/religionprof/2016/12/websters-dictionary-defines.html">Webster’s dictionary defines</a></del>—*cough*—<span class="citation" data-cites="hansson1994">(Hansson <a href="#ref-hansson1994">1994</a>)</span> says “decision theory is concerned with goal-directed behaviour in the presence of options”. We’ll try to make this description more comprehensive by appealing to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory/#SavThe">Leonard Savage’s formalization</a>. The hope is that by describing decision theory fully, we can see how the boundaries of the ideal theory debate line up with the boundaries of decision theory.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Savage starts by highlighting a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of initial states of the world, a set <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> of outcomes, and a set <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> of actions represented by functions from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(f(s_i)\)</span> denotes the outcome of action <span class="math inline">\(f \in F\)</span> when state <span class="math inline">\(s_i \in S\)</span> is the actual state of the world. Furthermore, we have a probability function <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> from states <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{I}\)</span> and a utility function <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> from outcomes <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> to utilities <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each of these elements has a parallel in the overall problem of social engineering. Descriptive social sciences like anthropology and sociology all advance different (overlapping) descriptions of the existing world—these correspond to Savage’s set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of world states. Our uncertainty about which description is correct corresponds to the probability function over states <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Things like emancipatory social science <span class="citation" data-cites="wright2010eru">(Wright <a href="#ref-wright2010eru">2010</a>)</span>, in part, outline the set of actions <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> available to transform our world into some outcome <span class="math inline">\(o \in O\)</span>. The task of determining which outcomes correspond to which actions is the job of <span class="noted">predictive social science like economics</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The proper utility function <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> assigning values to outcomes is debated by ethicists and political philosophers.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are a lot of moving pieces here because the problem of social engineering is complex. After apportioning out all the above responsibilities to different fields of study, what’s left over? In the purely formal context, we still have to determine which action in <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to take, in the face of all our assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, and what rules generate that recommendation—this is decision theory. And in the social engineering context, we still have to determine which world we ought to try to move to, in the face of all our positive and normative beliefs, and what rules generate that recommendation—this is the ideal theory debate. As <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span> says, “[T]he question that confronts the political theorist: … [W]hat moves (reforms) does our political philosophy recommend?”.</p>
<h1 id="so-what">So what?</h1>
<p>Let’s pretend you’re thoroughly convinced by this argument and move on. Is knowing that the ideal theory debate is actually about decision theory of any use? I think so. Here are some tools and concepts from decision theory that seem useful in the domain of ideal theory:</p>
<h2 id="von-neumann-morgenstern-utility-theorem">von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span> says one of the key distinctions between ideal theory and non-ideal theory is their ‘dimensionality’. Anti-idealists like Sen evaluate each world only with respect to its justice. Idealists are committed, he claims, to evaluating worlds on both their inherent justice and their proximity to the ideally just world. Anti-idealists are thus unidimensional while idealists are multidimensional. This distinction is explained more fully and formally in an <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/ideal-calibration/">earlier post</a>.</p>
<p>Decision theory almost insists on the unidimensional view. If we accept a certain set of very plausible axioms about our preferences over <span class="noted">lotteries</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> of possible worlds, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem</a> (there’s an alternate explanation of the theorem along with an interactive calculator in a <a href="posts/construct-vnm-utility-function-explained/">previous post</a>) shows that there exists a utility function <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> assigning real numbers to each outcome and rational agents will act as if they are maximizing the expected value of this function. Central to our point here is that the only decision-relevant dimension is the numbers that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> provides—our procedure is unidimensional. All considerations like the inherent justice of a social world or its proximity to other worlds are bundled into <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could argue about the appropriacy of the theorem here and our willingness to accept the axioms in the matter at hand. In particular, I imagine objections to the concept of lotteries over possible worlds. It’s not immediately obvious what a lottery consisting of a 20% probability of one world and a 80% probability of another world is. It’s not as though we can construct such a lottery by stepping ‘outside’ the world and picking one or the other world based on the result of a die roll. And there are extensive discussions about the nature of probability and how it ought to be interpreted—on frequentist grounds, as a subject Bayesian, as an objective Bayesian? Despite these difficulties, I’m not the only one to talk about probabilities over worlds. <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span>, for example, says, “[F]or any set C of constraints there is a probability distribution of possible social worlds that might emerge[.]”.</p>
<p>The VNM utility theorem doesn’t settle the debate unidimensional vs multidimensional debate once and for all—our quibbles about probability may turn out to be more than quibbles. But I think it is the beginnings of a strong argument in favor of the unidimensional view.</p>
<h2 id="epistemic-risk-aversion">Epistemic risk aversion</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span> highlights another consideration in support of non-ideal theory, the ‘Neighborhood Constraint’. The Neighborhood Constraint arises from the fact that “we have far better information about the realization of justice [in worlds similar to the status quo] than in far-flung social worlds”. From this fact (which I don’t dispute), he infers that we ought to focus on adjacent worlds and ignore the ideal (which I do dispute).</p>
<p>I think this attitude is a good exemplar of epistemic risk aversion, a topic in decision theory. The simplest form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion">risk aversion</a> is actuarial or aleatoric risk aversion. Someone exhibits this kind of risk aversion when they decline a fair bet. We can easily reconcile aleatoric risk aversion with rationality by remembering that utility in money can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function">concave</a>. Epistemic risk aversion or ambiguity aversion is a bit more complicated. It arises when the uncertainty about outcomes is a feature of our minds, not the world—the map, not the territory. It’s this second form of risk aversion which make the Neighborhood Constraint a constraint and not the Neighborhood Observation.</p>
<p>Making the connection between the ideal theory debate and decision theory here allows us to apply useful insights from the discussion in decision theory. In particular, we’ll start by acknowledging that the dominant decision rule in decision theory is that of maximizing expected value. Many are reluctant to treat epistemic risk differently from aleatory risk and would thus simply maximize expected utility in the social engineering problem, even in the face of uncertainty. This directly contravenes the Neighborhood Constraint. Even if you wanted to treat aleatory and epistemic risk differently, you probably wouldn’t come up with a rule that recommends you ignore any action that’s highly uncertain a la the Neighborhood Constraint. Instead, you might settle on something like maximin over expected utility as described in <span class="citation" data-cites="gardenfors1982">(Gärdenfors and Sahlin <a href="#ref-gardenfors1982">1982</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Decision theory then tends to argue against the Neighborhood Constraint as a constraint and proposes some alternative decision rules.</p>
<h2 id="sequential-decision-theory">Sequential decision theory</h2>
<p>A final problem with ideal theory that <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span> highlights is ‘The Choice’: “In cases where there is a clear social optimum within our neighborhood that requires movement away from our understanding of the ideal, we must choose between relatively certain (perhaps large) local improvements in justice and pursuit of a considerably less certain ideal.”</p>
<p>But I’d argue this is a bad framing. Sequential decision theory suggests that we shouldn’t evaluate the imminent decision only in terms of its immediate consequences. We must also evaluate how that decision affects future decisions and the whole eventual sequence of outcomes. Part of what makes any given possible world good or bad is its relationship to future possible worlds. As we discussed in <a href="#von-neumann-morgenstern-utility-theorem">the section on the VNM utility theorem</a>, all decision relevant factors are ultimately combined into a single dimension. If we accept this framing, we can never be confronted with a choice between optimizing on inherent justice and optimizing on proximity to the ideal because these aren’t the terms in which we address the problem.</p>
<p>Metaphorically, when Gaus advocates taking the branch of the fork that ignores the ideal in favor of the present, he’s advising that you “live every day as if it were your last”. The logic of the anti-ideal branch of The Choice would suggest that you always make your plans on Monday with zero regard for how that affects Tuesday. The idealizing branch would suggest that you spend your days journeying through Hell and back in the hopes of spending your final day in Heaven. Obviously, neither of these approaches is right.</p>
<p>When we view The Choice as an ordinary sequential decision problem, it’s clear that neither myopia nor hyperopia is correct. We have to integrate our forecasts of the future into our understanding of the present.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>We started with a tendentious description of the ideal theory debate. After briefly formalizing decision theory, I suggested that the ideal theory debate can be seen as applied decision theory. From this perspective, we turn up easy, compelling answers to the issues of: unidimensional vs multidimensional pursuit of justice, the Neighborhood Constraint, and The Choice.</p>

Alas, our working memory is tragically limited—traditionally, research suggests the upper limit on the number of ‘chunks’ in working memory is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">“magical number seven”</a>. (Interestingly, there’s some evidence that chimpanzees have superior working memory to humans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTgeLEWr614">Video</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(07)02088-X.pdf">paper</a>). Despite this grievous limitation, experience suggests that humans do actually carry out impressive feats of problem-solving. How?</p>
<h1 id="long-term-memory">Long-term memory</h1>
<p>The key is exploiting a ‘loophole’—“huge amounts of organized information can be transferred from long-term memory to working memory without overloading working memory” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span>. Thus, we arrive at the central importance of long-term memory to human cognition. Contra the denigration of rote memorization, “[task-relevant long-term memory] is the only reliable difference that has been obtained differentiating novices and experts in problem-solving skill and is the only difference required to fully explain why an individual is an expert in solving particular classes of problems” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span>. In other words, long-term memory is necessary and sufficient to explain expertise.</p>
<h2 id="chess-board-recall">Chess board recall</h2>
<p>We can make illustrate these claims with the results of a classic study <span class="citation" data-cites="degroot2014">(De Groot <a href="#ref-degroot2014">2014</a>)</span>. Look at the next image for a few seconds, close your eyes, and try to recall the positions of pieces.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>If you’re a chess amateur, this should have been quite hard (i.e. you probably misremembered the pieces). On the other hand, if you’re a chess expert, this was probably fairly straightforward.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now, look at the next image for a few seconds, close your eyes, and try to recall the positions of pieces.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/chess-fake.png" alt="Random chess configuration" class="chess-board" /><figcaption>Random chess configuration</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Because this is a random configuration of chess pieces that would never arise in an ordinary game, experts and novices alike should find board recall difficult.</p>
<p>Researchers interpret this as strong evidence of the centrality of task-specific long-term memory in expert performance. Novices have no choice but to recall the type, position and color of 10 separate pieces. The demands of this task easily exceed the capabilities of working memory. Experts can encode the same information in larger chunks by referring to existing knowledge in their long-term memory. These results also count as evidence against some plausible alternative explanations of chess expertise. If there were some innate aptitude for chess, we would, contrary to the fact of the matter, expect to find some novices with accurate recall on realistic board configurations like the first image. If chess experts were just generally smarter or chess expertise had broad scope, we would, contrary to the fact of the matter, expect to find that chess experts had good recall for even the random board configuration.</p>
<h1 id="adding-to-long-term-memory">Adding to long-term memory</h1>
<p>If long-term memory is central to cognition, the question of how to add more information to our long-term memory naturally arises. <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span> suggests that there are two possible modes of learning—deliberate transfer of deliberately constructed knowledge and random generation of propositions followed by tests for effectiveness—before concluding that “knowledge transfer is vastly more effective”. We won’t go into detail on random generation and testing here and instead skip straight to understanding how transfer works.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-load-theory">Cognitive load theory</h2>
<p>The unifying framework here is ‘cognitive load theory’. Cognitive load refers to the demands placed on working memory and cognitive load theory says that there are three key kinds of cognitive load present in any knowledge transfer situation—intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. Intrinsic cognitive load reflects the essential complexity of the material to be learned. Extraneous cognitive load reflects the incidental complexity arising from instructional design. Germane cognitive load reflects the effort required to transform and store the information to be learned. Because these three types of demand for working memory are additive, optimizing learning in the face of our supremely finite working memory amounts to minimizing extraneous cognitive load and maximizing germane cognitive load, especially in the face of subject matter with high intrinsic complexity.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>We can briefly see the practical value of this theory by listing some of the instructional recommendations it generates:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Worked example effect</dt>
<dd><p>“[N]ovice learners studying worked solutions to problems perform better on a problem-solving test than learners who have been given the equivalent problems to solve during training” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span>. The attention devoted to the problem-solving procedure leaves less available for germane cognitive load and committing the correct procedures to memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Split attention effect</dt>
<dd><p>If non-redundant instructional information is presented in two separate sources (e.g. in a diagram and in a textual description), learners must mentally integrate the information which imposes extraneous cognitive load. This impairs learning.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Redundancy effect</dt>
<dd><p>If redundant instructional material is presented (e.g. a textual description of blood flow in the human circulatory system which repeats information available in a diagram of the body with arrows), it impairs learning. Examining unnecessary information and attempting to integrate it imposes extraneous cognitive load.</p>

    <title>An example of the lazy approach to AI safety</title>

    <updated>2018-07-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Examples often clarify. Let’s see an example of the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/lazy-ai-safety/">lazy approach to AI safety</a> in action.</p>
<h1 id="the-setting">The setting</h1>
<p>Suppose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Professor_(Gilligan%27s_Island)">The Professor</a> has performed another bamboo miracle and built an AI agent on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island">island</a>. Sadly, the castaways forgot the agent in their frantic final escape. So it’s just our agent, alone on an island in the Pacific.</p>
<p>As a man of taste and refinement, the professor has followed the lazy approach to AI safety. As such, the agent’s utility futility is quite simple: The utility of any state of affairs is exactly the moral good of that state of affairs according to whatever turns out to be the <span class="noted">One True Moral Theory (OTMT)</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In symbols, <span class="math inline">\(u(x) = g(x)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of possible states of affairs, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the utility function, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> evaluates the moral goodness of a state of affairs according to the OTMT.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we’ll suppose there are only two possible interventions the agent can make: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ze">Ze</a> can harvest coconuts or harvest bamboo. Furthermore, we’ll fiat that there are only two possible moral theories in all the world: the coconut imperative and bamboocentrism. According to the coconut imperative, the goodness of a state of affairs is defined as <span class="math inline">\(g_c(b, c) = 0 \cdot b + 3 \cdot c\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the total number of coconuts that have been harvested and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the total number of bamboo shoots that have been harvested. On the bamboocentric view of things, <span class="math inline">\(g_b(b, c) = 2 \cdot b + 0 \cdot c\)</span>. (The fact that we only have moral theories which express goodness in terms of real numbers permits our earlier simplification of assuming that the OTMT takes this shape.)</p>
<h1 id="initial-behavior">Initial behavior</h1>
<p>Before the Professor <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/will-arnett-UGAwRa9KWjO2Q/fullscreen">abandoned his child</a>, he programmed the agent with a uniform prior over all possible ethical theories. That is, the agent thinks there’s a 50% chance bamboocentrism is true and a 50% chance the coconut imperative is the OTMT. Thus, in the absence of better information, the agent spends zir days harvesting coconuts (we assume the resources required to harvest a coconut are identical to the resources required to harvest a bamboo stalk). To be fully explicit:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} E[\Delta u(h_b)] &amp;= E[u(b + 1, c) - u(b, c)] \\ &amp;= E[u(b + 1, c)] - E[u(b, c)] \\ &amp;= E[g(b + 1, c)] - E[g(b, c)] \\ &amp;= (\frac{1}{2} \cdot g_b(b + 1, c) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_c(b + 1, c)) - (\frac{1}{2} \cdot g_b(b, c) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_c(b, c)) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_b(b + 1, c) - \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_b(b, c) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (2 \cdot (b + 1) + 0 \cdot c) - \frac{1}{2} (2 \cdot b + 0 \cdot c) \\ &amp;= 1 \end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} E[\Delta u(h_c)] &amp;= E[u(b, c + 1) - u(b, c)] \\ &amp;= E[u(b, c + 1)] - E[u(b, c)] \\ &amp;= E[g(b, c + 1)] - E[g(b, c)] \\ &amp;= (\frac{1}{2} \cdot g_b(b, c + 1) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_c(b, c + 1)) - (\frac{1}{2} \cdot g_b(b, c) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_c(b, c)) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_c(b, c + 1) - \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_c(b, c) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (0 \cdot b + 3 \cdot (c + 1)) - \frac{1}{2} (0 \cdot b + 3 \cdot c) \\ &amp;= 1.5 \end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>In words, the expected utility gain from harvesting a bamboo stalk <span class="math inline">\(E[\Delta u(h_b)]\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> util and thus less than the expected utility gain of <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> from harvesting a coconut <span class="math inline">\(E[\Delta u(h_c)]\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="moral-investigation">Moral investigation</h1>
<p>Now, suppose a magic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">Magic 8-Ball</a> washes up on the island as narrative devices so obligingly did in ’60s television. Somehow this 8-Ball is a moral oracle able to reveal the OTMT with certainty and somehow the agent knows and believes this. In exchange for this knowledge, the 8-Ball asks for nothing less than an <em>immortal SOUL</em>—*cough* some utils. Should the agent accept this utils for info bargain? The lazy approach to AI safety perspective suggests the next step is to calculate the value of this moral information.</p>
<p>If we go back to the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/value-information-calculator/">value of information calculator</a> and paste in our scenario:</p>
<pre><code>- outcome:
    finding: coconut imperative is correct
    choices:
    - choice: harvest coconut
      results:
      - outcome: {label: coconut imperative, value: 3}
        prob: 1
      - outcome: {label: bamboocentrism, value: 0}
        prob: 0
    - choice: harvest bamboo
      results:
      - outcome: {label: coconut imperative, value: 0}
        prob: 1
      - outcome: {label: bamboocentrism, value: 2}
        prob: 0
  prob: 0.5
- outcome:
    finding: bamboocentrism is correct
    choices:
    - choice: harvest coconut
      results:
      - outcome: {label: coconut imperative, value: 3}
        prob: 0
      - outcome: {label: bamboocentrism, value: 0}
        prob: 1
    - choice: harvest bamboo
      results:
      - outcome: {label: coconut imperative, value: 0}
        prob: 0
      - outcome: {label: bamboocentrism, value: 2}
        prob: 1
  prob: 0.5</code></pre>
<p>we find that the expected value of information is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. This makes sense. Based on the agent’s current beliefs, there’s a 50% chance ze’ll find out bamboocentrism is true and harvest bamboo accordingly. Ze’d generate <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> utils in such a scenario. There’s also a 50% chance that the 8-Ball will reveal that the coconut imperative is correct and the agent would get <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> utils there for acting accordingly. So the expected value with perfect information is <span class="math inline">\(2.5\)</span> and the current expected value is <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(2.5 - 1.5 = 1\)</span> so the agent should be willing to pay up to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> util per expected future harvesting decision. For example, if the agent expects the island to be consumed in a fiery volcano imminently (precluding further harvesting), ze shouldn’t sacrifice any utils for the info. On the other hand, if the agent will make ten more harvesting decisions, ze should be willing to pay the 8-Ball up to <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> utils.</p>
<h1 id="outro">Outro</h1>
<p>Obviously, our example is grossly simplified. Among other things, we assume a tiny set of moral theories, a tiny fixed set of actions, and a moral oracle. The hope is that the simplification makes the core, novel elements easier to grasp and that the complexities can be reintroduced later.</p>

    <title>False dichotomies and the ideal theory debate</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is deprecated in favor of <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/ideal-theory-decision-theory">Ideal theory and decision theory</a>.</p>
<h1 id="ideal-and-non-ideal-theory">Ideal and non-ideal theory</h1>
<p>We’ve already described ideal theory in <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/utopia-infinitude-secretaries/">previous posts</a>, but we’ll give a short recap here for the sake of self-sufficiency. Ideal theory suggests that when making decisions about alternative social worlds—that is, about different political and economic institutions, we should have an ideally just society in mind. Non-idealists argue that this information is irrelevant; we only need to be able to perform pairwise comparisons. A popular metaphor in the area is that of mountain climbing. In the language of this metaphor, ideal theorists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a> suggest that mountaineers orient themselves toward Everest while non-idealists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen">Amartya Sen</a> suggest that knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest">Everest</a> is irrelevant when comparing the heights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro">Kilimanjaro</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali">Denali</a>.</p>
<h1 id="thesis">Thesis</h1>
<p>I contend this is a debate which can be <a href="http://askphilosophers.com/question/5254">dissolved</a>. There is no necessary opposition between incrementalism and idealism. Instead, all of these perspectives can be ably unified under the framework of decision theory.</p>
<h1 id="dichotomy">Dichotomy</h1>
<p>Before I can make the argument that’s it’s a <em>false</em> dichotomy, I need to show that it’s a putative dichotomy. There’s little value in attacking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw men</a>. Since I’ve just read <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span>, we’ll examine that in detail and expect that it’s representative of the larger discussion.</p>
<p>The boundary that Gaus draws is between worlds in the ‘neighborhood’ of the status quo and those outside it. If we restrict our attention to worlds in the neighborhood, we’re engaging in non-ideal theory, but if we speculate on distant worlds we’re doing ideal theory. What is this key neighborhood concept? In Gaus’s words: “A neighborhood delimits a set of nearby social worlds characterized by relatively similar justice-relevant social structures.”</p>
<p>So we’re already on firm grounds for a claim of dichotomous thinking. On this view, the <span class="noted">structure of the problem is dichotomous</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. But Gaus also demonstrates the dichotomous view when describing the divergent implications of the ideal and non-ideal view:</p>
<blockquote>
[L]ocal optimization often points in a different direction than pursuit of the ideal. We then confront what I have called <span id="the-choice">The Choice</span>: should we turn our back on local optimization and move toward the ideal? [… O]ur judgments within our neighborhood have better warrant than judgments outside of it; if the ideal is outside our current neighborhood, then we are forgoing relatively clear gains in justice for an uncertain prospect that our realistic utopia lies in a different direction. <span class="noted">Mill’s revolutionaries</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, certain of their own wisdom and judgment, were more than willing to commit society to the pursuit of their vision of the ideal; their hubris had terrible costs for many.
</blockquote>
<h1 id="similarities">Similarities</h1>
<p>Now, I’ll hope you agree ideal and non-ideal theory are framed as incompatible. On that assumption, I’ll begin to argue against the dichotomy.</p>
<h2 id="uncertainty-all-around">Uncertainty all around</h2>
<p>I do accept Gaus’s Neigborhood Constraint—our knowledge of distant social words is much less reliable than our knowledge of worlds similar to the status quo. Furthermore, I think we have non-trivial uncertainties about the workings and justice of worlds that <em>are</em> nearby. Importantly, (though not, I think, crucially) I don’t see any obvious reason for discontinuities in the reliability of our knowledge. My intuition suggests it drops off smoothly with distance from the status quo <span id="reliability" class="spark"></span>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="foresight-all-around">Foresight all around</h2>
<p>Non-idealists not only contend that our knowledge of the ideal is highly uncertain, they suggest it’s otiose. On the contrary, knowledge about world C is useful for evaluating worlds A and B not only when C is the ideal but when all of A, B, and C are in the same neighborhood. As long as we don’t expect the next world we inhabit to be the last world we ever inhabit, a thorough evaluation of that next world should include it’s likely effects on the subsequent chain of worlds. That is, an evaluation which judges B against A only on the immediate effects and not on how B enables and forecloses other nearby possibilities like C is a very blinkered analysis indeed. So again, we see a difference of degree rather than kind—we should surely evaluate the knock-on effects of our choices and the only real question is how rapidly does the value of such estimation decline as we step into the future and away from the status quo.</p>
<h1 id="decision-theory">Decision theory</h1>
<p>Finally, the promised unification. If we believe the story so far, key problems in ideal theorizing include making <a href="#the-choice">hard trade-offs</a>, <a href="#uncertainty-all-around">choice under uncertainty</a>, and <a href="#foresight-all-around">intertemporal choice</a>. But these are precisely the problems that decision theory (broadly construed) seeks to address!</p>
<p>For example, decision theory offers fairly straightforward recommendations in Gaus’s Choice (between pursuing local improvements and the ideal when they point in opposite directions). If you buy into an expected utility maximizing decision theory, you simply calculate the value of each choice on offer, accounting for uncertainty and risk aversion, and pick the maximal.</p>
<p>And decision theory doesn’t recommend that you ignore the ideal just because it’s uncertain—it never helps to throw away information. You can incorporate your limited understanding of the ideal and any reasonable decision theory will guard against tyrannies of hubris by weighting certain and speculative knowledge differently.</p>
<p>A final example of the decision theory perspective dissolving these problems: Decision theories can generally accommodate sequences of decisions over time and allow the formulation of optimal strategies. Problems like evaluating worlds in light of the futures they encourage and discourage aren’t foreign to decision theory—optimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit</a> algorithms, for example, will sacrifice near-term gains for better long-run outcomes.</p>
<p>(Actually using these techniques well for political philosophizing is difficult. The difficulty of application does little to convince me this is the wrong approach—I’d expect it to be hard to determine an optimal trajectory through possible worlds.)</p>
<h1 id="a-parting-metaphor">A parting metaphor</h1>
<p>Suppose you’re playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em">Texas hold’em</a> at some louche casino. You’ve just been dealt your pocket cards. Now, imagine some bon vivant sidles up behind you and advises, “Don’t worry about what the river might turn up! It’s so far away and uncertain; just think about the flop. Not to mention, optimizing for the river might lead to worse play in the near term.” The only proper response is to tell the lush to sober up and take their sloppy heuristics elsewhere. You believe in decision theory, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Obviously, the metaphor isn’t perfect. But it’s crystal clear you should use decision theory for poker and, at this point, I think the (rebuttable) presumption is we should use it for political philosophizing as well.</p>

    <title>Lee Kuan Yew—Deity or dude?</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/is-development-easy/">previous post</a>, I presented a puzzle: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>’s <em>The Singapore Story</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="yew2012">(Yew <a href="#ref-yew2012">2012</a>)</span> makes the incredible success of Singapore sound easy, but everything else I know suggests that growth and governance are far from easy. How do we explain the discrepancy?</p>
<p>One explanation that I think some people advance is that these problems are genuinely difficult, but they crumble before the searing brilliance of LKY (Lee Kuan Yew). I’ll confess that I had thought this might be the case before reading. Based on the memoir, I’m come to believe that LKY is closer to competent than Promethean.</p>
<h1 id="he-put-his-pants-on-one-leg-at-a-time">He put his pants on one leg at a time</h1>
<p>First, we’ll start with some trifling excerpts which suggest that, indeed, LKY is an ordinary mortal:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
Eating and talking through the meal while conserving energy and not letting myself go and drink in case I lose my sharp cutting edge is quite a strain. It is part of the price to promote American investments.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[H]owever hard and hectic the day had been, I would take two hours off in the late afternoon to go on the practice tee to hit 50–100 balls and play nine holes with one or two friends.
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="facile-solutions-to-complex-problems">Facile solutions to complex problems</h1>
<p>He also sometimes responds to problems with solutions that seem like they can’t possibly be sufficient:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
Visiting CEOs used to call on me before making investment decisions. I thought the best way to convince them was to ensure that the roads from the airport to their hotel and to my office were neat and spruce, lined with shrubs and trees. When they drove into the Istana domain, they would see right in the heart of the city a green oasis, 90 acres of immaculate rolling lawns and woodland, and nestling between them a nine-hole golf course.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
The most effective [anti-corruption] change we made in 1960 was to allow the courts to treat proof that an accused was living beyond his means or had property his income could not explain as corroborating <span class="noted">evidence that the accused had accepted or obtained a bribe</span>[^corruption]. With a keen nose to the ground and the power to investigate every officer and every minister, the director of the CPIB, working from the Prime Minister’s Office, developed a justly formidable reputation for sniffing out those betraying the public trust.
</blockquote>
<p>It’s my understanding that anti-corruption measures are often a double-edge sword; they’re just as ably used by ruthless politicians to eliminate competition. In fact, LKY alludes to this very behavior elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
[D]uring the height of the Cultural Revolution, 1966–76, the system broke down. […] The whole society was degraded as opportunists masqueraded as revolutionaries and achieved “helicopter promotions” by betraying and persecuting their peers or superiors.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[…] Singapore should not have a central bank which could issue currency and create money. We were determined not to allow our currency to lose its value against the strong currencies of the big nations, especially the United States. So we retained our currency board which issued Singapore dollars only when backed by its equivalent value in foreign exchange.
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy">Monetary policy</a> has real value and it’s far from obvious that the winning move is not to play.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
[On limiting social programs:] We have arranged help but in such a way that only those who have no other choice will seek it. This is the opposite of attitudes in the West, where liberals actively encourage people to demand their entitlements with no sense of shame, causing an explosion of welfare costs.
</blockquote>
<p>An alternative consequence is those with the most acute sense of social responsibility will forgo entitlements and the most shameless will avail themselves of entitlements.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
Soon afterwards we also phased out protection for the assembly of refrigerators, air-conditioners, television sets, radios and other consumer electrical and electronic products.
</blockquote>
<p>Economic theory both recommends free trade for its positive impact on aggregate productivity and warns of its distributional consequences. I saw no engagement with the latter concern in the memoirs.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
[…] I wanted: good health services, with waste and costs kept in check by requiring co-payments from the user. Subsidies for health care were necessary, but could be extremely wasteful and ruinous for the budget.
</blockquote>
<p>Requiring co-payments doesn’t solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard">moral hazard</a>—it only mitigates. There are no easy solutions that eliminate moral hazard <em>and</em> retain subsidies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, I’m not suggesting that these are easy problems or that I know the answer. In fact, that’s precisely my complaint—it seems LKY is suggesting they <em>are</em> problems with simple answers. One might respond that LKY <em>had</em> to make choices and didn’t have the luxury of indecision. I grant that, but think his presentation of these problems is less ‘forced to make the least bad choice when confronted with unsolved dilemmas’ and more ‘plucked out an answer to a trivialized problem’.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="contradictions">Contradictions</h1>
<p>There are also occasions on which LKY seems to contradict himself. If indeed he does, he’s decidedly fallible. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Throughout, LKY emphasizes the importance of economic rationality and incentives. Then we get snippets like:</p>
<blockquote>
The [Stock Exchange of Singapore] was closed for three days while [Monetary Authority of Singapore] officials, led by Koh Beng Seng, worked around the clock with the Big Four banks to arrange an emergency “lifeboat” fund of S$180 million to rescue the stockbrokers. Koh’s efforts enabled the SES to avoid systemic market failure.
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">too big to fail</a> and moral hazard years before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">global financial crisis</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
The [Housing &amp; Development Board] started with a demonstration phase for older flats, spending S$58,000 per flat to upgrade the estates and build additional space for a utility room, bathroom or kitchen extension, but charging the owner only S$4,500.
</blockquote>
<p>It seems hard to imagine that this didn’t have distortionary effects.</p></li>
<li><p>LKY promoted eugenic programs as a response to:</p>
<blockquote>
Our best women were not reproducing themselves because men who were their educational equals did not want to marry them. About half of our university graduates were women; nearly two-thirds of them were unmarried.
</blockquote>
<p>He seems not to notice that his eugenic concerns are solved by symmetry:</p>
<blockquote>
The result was that the least-educated men could find no women to marry, because the women who remained unmarried were all better-educated and would not marry them.
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="wrong">Wrong</h1>
<p>There are also some occasions on which he is, to the best of my knowledge, just plain wrong. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
I quoted studies of identical twins done in Minnesota in the 1980s which showed that these twins were similar in so many respects. Although they had been brought up separately and in different countries, about 80 per cent of their vocabulary, IQ, habits, likes and dislikes in food and friends, and other character and personality traits were identical. In other words, nearly 80 per cent of a person’s makeup was from nature, and about 20 per cent the result of nurture.
</blockquote>
<p>I think his last sentence is a gesture to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability">heritability</a>. Alas, it is not even a good popular interpretation of the concept.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
After what I had seen of human conduct in the years of deprivation and harshness of Japanese occupation, I did not accept the theory that a criminal is a victim of society. Punishment then was so severe that even in 1944–45, when many did not have enough to eat, there were no burglaries and people could leave their front doors on latch, day or night. The deterrent was effective.
</blockquote>
<p>LKY seems to generalize this in support of severe punishment generally. However, I think <span class="noted">the literature generally suggests that the severity of punishment is less important</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> for deterrence than other factors <span class="citation" data-cites="wright2010">(Wright <a href="#ref-wright2010">2010</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We’ve seen a variety of ways in which LKY isn’t beyond reproach. This puts an upper bound on his competence and suggests that we can’t explain the apparent ease of Singapore’s development by appealing to his singular qualities.</p>

    <title>Exemplar's curse—Now with 80% more math!</title>

    <updated>2018-07-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/exemplars-curse-singapore/">Last time</a>, I outlined the exemplar’s curse in the context of Singapore with a parable and an informal description. Rest easy; I’ve heard your needful clamoring—I’ll now describe the curse more precisely with math.</p>
<h1 id="the-exemplars-curse">The exemplar’s curse</h1>
<p>Restating the core idea in words: The exemplar’s curse occurs when we select an exemplar from a set of outcomes which resulted from both stochastic and deterministic factors. If many outcomes have similarly compelling deterministic factors, the chosen winner is probably unusually lucky. Reversion to the mean then suggests that the chosen winner will disappoint when the deterministic factors are replicated.</p>
<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>(If you don’t like the mathematical exposition that follows, you can also try <span class="citation" data-cites="barnett2004">(Barnett, Van Der Pols, and Dobson <a href="#ref-barnett2004">2004</a>)</span>.)</p>
<p>We can model this with the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable">random variables</a>. We’ll call our bundle of deterministic factors <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> and say they range uniformly in cumulative value from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is finite. Our bundle of stochastic factors <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> range uniformly in value from from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is finite. Since we observe only visible outcomes rather than underlying causal factors, we see <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{D} + \mathcal{S}\)</span>. The exemplar’s curse is then about the inferrable properties of the causal factors <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> corresponding to the selected maximum <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> from a set of outcomes <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{O}\)</span>. In other words, if we have a set of observable outcomes <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{O}\)</span> and select the best outcome from that set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>, what can we infer about the underlying structure of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>—how big are that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>’s <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>?</p>
<h1 id="false-exemplars">False exemplars</h1>
<p>In the last post, we only went so far as to claim that we should expect replicating causal factors to produce disappointing outcomes due to reversion to the mean. That is, the stochastic factors <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_1\)</span> for the maximum outcome <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_1 = \max \mathbb{O}\)</span> are likely better than average (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{2}\)</span>). If we generate a new outcome <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_2\)</span> using the same deterministic factors <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> that served us well in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_1\)</span>, we should expect our new stochastic factors to be worse <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_2 &lt; \mathcal{S}_1\)</span> and so we should expect <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_2 &lt; \mathcal{O}_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This leaves a open a compelling retort. One could say, “Even though I’m too optimistic about the eventual outcome, in selecting the exemplar, I’m still selecting the best deterministic factors. That means I’m still making the best choice I can so no harm done.”</p>
<p>Alas, this is not true. Depending on the parameters, there could be only a vanishingly small chance that the bundle of deterministic factors corresponding to the best outcome (the sum of the deterministic and stochastic factors) is also the best bundle of deterministic factors when looking <em>only</em> at the deterministic factors. In symbols, supposing we have a projection function <span class="math inline">\(p_\mathcal{D} : \mathbb{O} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}\)</span> which finds the bundle of deterministic factors <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> used in outcome <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>, we’re interested in <span class="math inline">\(P(\max \mathbb{D} = p_\mathcal{D}(\max \mathbb{O}))\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if we choose the max from 1000 outcomes and the value of stochastic factors ranges from 0 to 100 while the value of deterministic factors ranges from 0 to 1, we should be quite surprised if our best outcome actually has the best deterministic factors.</p>
<h1 id="calculator">Calculator</h1>
<p>We can help build up an intuition around this math using the calculator below. The calculator uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo methods</a> to estimate the probability that the maximum outcome corresponds to the maximum bundle of deterministic factors.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>You can change the range of values for stochastic and deterministic factors and change the number of outcomes we’re taking the max from (i.e. Our winner is the winner out of how many contestants?).</p>
<p>This results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean value of stochastic factors in best outcomes across Monte Carlo samples. This allows us to estimate the magnitude of expected mean regression.</li>
<li>An estimated probability that our observed best outcome actually corresponds to the best bundle of deterministic factors.</li>
<li>A chart showing all the trials used to produce the estimate. One interesting thing to note about the chart is that the number of points on the diagonal corresponds to the probability of ‘success’ (i.e. the probability that the best outcome also has the best deterministic factors).</li>
</ul>
<form>
<p>Stochastic factors: 0 to <input id="stochastic-max" type="number" min="0" value="1" step="0.1" /></p>
<p>Deterministic factors: 0 to <input id="deterministic-max" type="number" min="0" value="1" step="0.1" /></p>
<p>Number of outcomes to choose max from: <input id="num-contestants" type="number" min="1" value="5" /></p>
</form>
<output>
<p>Mean of stochastic factors across samples: <span id="mean-stochastic">0.75</span></p>
<p>Probability best measured outcome has best deterministic factors: <span id="prob-max">0.5</span></p>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Comparing deterministic component of best outcome to best deterministic component across Monte Carlo samples</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="combined-chart">

</div>
</figure>
</output>
<p>Some trends worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>As the stochastic factors get relatively larger, the probability goes down</li>
<li>As the deterministic factors get relatively larger, the probability goes down</li>
<li>As the number of outcomes goes up, the probability goes down and the mean of stochastic factors goes up</li>
</ul>
<p>This confirms the intuition highlighted by the example a few paragraphs up.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So we see that the exemplar’s curse is even worse than we thought. It’s not just about our outcomes regressing to the mean in spite of making the best possible choice. It will often lead us to pick the wrong exemplar!</p>

    <title>The Exemplar's Curse and Singapore</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-exemplars-curse">The exemplar’s curse</h1>
<h2 id="a-parable">A parable</h2>
<p>Suppose you walk into the nearest WalMart, get on the PA, and ask everyone to congregate in the attached warehouse. Once the congregation has settled, you reveal a ream of printer paper, ask everyone to fold their best paper airplane, and finally ask everyone to toss their planes as far as they can. Once everyone’s tossed, you pull out your handy-dandy tape measure and determine which plane flew the farthest.</p>
<p>So far, so good. However, if you then proceed to marvel at the winning plane and attribute its long flight to the artful pattern of creases, you’re likely to err. Because, of course, there’s a substantial element of luck (meant in a casual sense; let’s not careen off on a tangent about determinism) in the outcome of the contest—it’s not a pure contest of skill. And in choosing the extreme value (the winner), we’ve positively selected for luck. This means our winner will likely have better than average luck. This result—in contests where many contestants are skilled, the outcome is often determined by luck—goes by the name <a href="http://mutualfunds.com/education/alpha-and-the-paradox-of-skill/">the paradox of skill</a>.</p>
<p>The unfortunate conclusion to this parable is that we should expect planes modeled after our winner to do worse than the original. Because the winner was unusually lucky, subsequent flights will experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">reversion to the mean</a> and perform worse.</p>
<p>Or, another route to this intuition: Even if you ran the contest again with the exact same planes, a different pattern of air drafts, a different incidental flick of the wrist might well result in a different victor. It’s only after we’ve run many trials and looked at the pattern of results for each plane that we can bring the risk of a false victor down to acceptable levels. If luck is a significant factor and there are many contestants, chances are that this true, final victor is not the same as the plane that happened to win the first trial. This is why sporting events often have multiple matches in a series—to diminish the impact of luck and suss out skill.</p>
<h2 id="abstracted">Abstracted</h2>
<p>Summarizing, the exemplar’s curse occurs when you’re selecting an exemplar from a set of outcomes which resulted from both stochastic and deterministic factors. If many outcomes have <span class="noted">similarly compelling deterministic factors</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the chosen winner is probably unusually lucky. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">Regression to the mean</a> then suggests that the chosen winner will disappoint when the deterministic factors are replicated.</p>
<h2 id="optimizers-curse">Optimizer’s curse</h2>
<p>The following is offered as an extra in case it helps. If it doesn’t, dismiss it with prejudice:</p>
<p>The perspicacious reader will have noticed that this is just the optimizer’s curse dressed up in causal clothes <span class="citation" data-cites="smith2006">(Smith and Winkler <a href="#ref-smith2006">2006</a>)</span>. The paradigmatic optimizer’s curse warns about the difficulty of selecting actions based on the predicted value of the action. In such circumstances, naive optimizer’s will likely be disappointed because they will systematically pick actions based on overoptimistic predictions. (If this explanation doesn’t do it for you, you can just read the beginning of the linked paper; it’s not bad.) Our exemplar’s curse is structurally similar—we just have uncertain causal inference about the past instead of uncertain predictions about the future.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="singapore-as-exemplar">Singapore as exemplar</h1>
<p>With that bit of groundwork laid, we can return to our discussion of Singapore. Could this be an exemplar’s curse? Our criteria were: Selecting on an extreme, outcome determined by both stochastic and deterministic factors, several candidates with similarly compelling deterministic factors. Looking at our criteria we see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re looking at Singapore because it has extremely high, sustained growth.</li>
<li>I am not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_determinism">historical determinist</a> so I do believe that luck plays a role in the course of history and in development. Another route to the claim that there’s luck in development is just to point out that all our existing growth models have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals">residuals</a>. No model has yet identified all the causal factors for growth and squeezed out the stochastic remainder.</li>
<li>It’s hard to know whether other polities besides Singapore have similarly effective (though different) policies, institutions, and other deterministic factors. But I don’t think we can rule out that possibility. <span class="noted">To do so would be to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">beg the question</a>.</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>For fun, here are some excerpts that sounded like Singapore getting <span class="noted">lucky</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> to me <span class="citation" data-cites="yew2012">(Yew <a href="#ref-yew2012">2012</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
I told Keng Swee to proceed with the Israelis [training the early Singapore armed forces], but to keep it from becoming public knowledge for as long as possible so as not to provoke grassroots antipathy from Malay Muslims in Malaysia and Singapore. [It worked.]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In Jakarta, an Indonesian crowd rampaged through the Singapore embassy, shattering pictures of the president of Singapore and generally wreaking havoc, but did not burn the embassy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Our break came with a visit by Texas Instruments in October 1968. They wanted to set up a plant to assemble semiconductors, at that time a high-technology product, and were able to start production within 50 days of their decision. Close on their heels came National Semiconductor. Soon after, their competitor, Hewlett-Packard (HP), sent out a scout.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The new [political opponents] were lacklustre and did not measure up. Chiam was constructive and could have built up a sizeable political party had he been a shrewder judge of people. In 1992 he proudly produced a plausible young lecturer as his prize candidate for a by-election. Within two years, his protégé had ousted him as the leader and forced him to form a new party.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We then agreed to a Malaysian proposal that one Malaysian regiment be sent down to Camp Temasek. The 2nd battalion SIR was due to return from its duties in Borneo in February 1966, and arrangements were made at staff level for the Malaysian regiment to withdraw. The Malaysian defence minister requested that instead of reoccupying Camp Temasek, one Singapore battalion should be sent to the Malayan mainland to enable the Malaysian regiment to remain where it was. Keng Swee did not agree. We wanted both our own battalions in Singapore. We believed the Malaysians had changed their minds because they wanted to keep one battalion of Malaysian forces in Singapore to control us. The Malaysians refused to move out, so the SIR advance party had to live under canvas at Farrer Park.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the British vacated a camp called Khatib in the north of Singapore, near Sembawang. We offered it to the Malaysians and they agreed in mid-March 1966 to move out of our camp to Khatib, where they remained for 18 months before withdrawing of their own accord in November 1967.</p>

<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>If we believe this story that Singapore suffers from the exemplar’s curse, how should we respond? It means that we should be a little more cautious in trying to generalize the successes of Singapore. The institutions and policies that seemed successful there might result in more average outcomes when replicated elsewhere.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="singapores-economy-grew.-a-lot.">Singapore’s economy grew. A lot.</h1>
<p>It’s pretty hard to argue with the claim that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>’s post-independence economic development is an astounding success. <em>Per capita</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> in the country grew from $6,506 (inflation-adjusted 2010 USD) in 1970 (57th among all countries) to $46,569 in 2010 (18th among all countries) <span class="citation" data-cites="gdp_per_capita_singapore">(“Constant GDP Per Capita for Singapore”)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="gdp_per_capita_table">(“List of Countries by Past and Projected GDP (Nominal) Per Capita” <a href="#ref-gdp_per_capita_table">2018</a>)</span>. This represents an average annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)">real</a> growth rate of 5.04% <span id="singapore-gdp" class="spark"></span>. For comparison, the real growth rates of China and the US over the same period of time were <span class="noted">7.78%</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span id="china-gdp" class="spark"></span> and 1.84% <span id="us-gdp" class="spark"></span> respectively <span class="citation" data-cites="gdp_per_capita_china">(“Constant GDP Per Capita for China”)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="gdp_per_capita_usa">(“Constant GDP Per Capita for the United States”)</span>.</p>
<p>Alas, broader measures of progress over that time period aren’t readily available. The UN’s <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">Human Development Index</a>, for example, only goes back to 1990. Thus, for want of a better measure, we’ll have to rely on GDP to support our claim that things really did change radically in Singapore after independence.</p>
<h1 id="whats-so-hard-about-growth-just-stop-making-bad-decisions-and-start-making-good-ones.">What’s so hard about growth? Just stop making bad decisions and start making good ones.</h1>
<p>A book club I recently attended read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew">Lee Kuan Yew’s</a> (the prime minister of Singapore from independence in 1965 to 1990) memoir, <em>The Singapore Story</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="yew2012">(Yew <a href="#ref-yew2012">2012</a>)</span>. My friend’s first reaction to the book was, “He makes it sound so easy!”, and I can’t disagree. My overwhelming impression of the book is that of proficient nonchalance.</p>
<p>Some examples from the text which I hope convey that feeling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
I had many pressing concerns: first, to get international recognition for Singapore’s independence, including our membership of the United Nations. I chose Sinnathamby Rajaratnam (affectionately called Raja by all of us) as foreign minister. […] He was to be much liked and respected by all those he worked with at home and abroad. As messages of recognition flowed in, Toh Chin Chye, the deputy prime minister, and Raja as foreign minister set off to New York to take our seat at the UN that September of 1965.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Mordecai Kidron, the Israeli ambassador in Bangkok […] had approached me several times in 1962–63 to ask for an Israeli consulate in Singapore. […] I replied that it … [might] create an issue that would excite the Malay Muslim grassroots and upset my plans […].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[N]ow that the Israeli presence in Singapore was well-known, we allowed them a diplomatic mission. They wanted an embassy. We decided to allow them a trade representative office first, in October 1968. The following May, after Malay Muslims in Singapore and the region had become accustomed to an Israeli presence, we allowed them to upgrade it to an embassy.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
Seah Mui Kok, a union leader and PAP MP, another old friend from my time with the unions, objected to the wide latitude given to employers to hire and fire, but accepted the need for unions to be less confrontational to create a better climate for foreign investments. I included safeguards against misuse of these powers.
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
We suffered a reverse in the Asian financial crisis of 1997: unemployment increased to 3.2 per cent in 1998. To regain our competitiveness, the unions and government agreed and implemented a package of measures that reduced wages and other costs by 15 per cent […]
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
From 1955 to 1968 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Provident_Fund">CPF</a> contribution had remained unchanged. I raised it in stages from 5 per cent to 25 per cent in 1984, making a total [compulsory] savings rate of 50 per cent of wages. This was later reduced to 40 per cent.
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="am-i-out-of-touch-no-its-lee-kuan-yew-that-is-wrong.">Am I out of touch? No, it’s Lee Kuan Yew that is wrong.</h1>
<p>The proposition that growth and governance are easy is—to say the least—contrary to my impression. I’m not prepared to make a rigorous argument for the claim that ‘development is hard’ but some fragments which I think inform my intuition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The middling-at-best success with respect to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals">Millenium Development Goals</a></p></li>
<li><p>The persistence of the Africa dummy:</p>
<blockquote>
In his landmark empirical study of economic growth, Barro […] acknowledged that “there appear to be adverse effects on growth from being in Sub-Saharan Africa” which his model could not explain despite controlling for the level of investments, government consumption, school enrollments and political instability. In fact, the dummy variable which he used to assess whether a country was African—the “Africa dummy”—was significantly associated with an annual decline in per capita GDP of as much as 1.14% during 1960–85.&quot; <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="englebert2000">(Englebert <a href="#ref-englebert2000">2000</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The mixed success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_economy">post-Soviet transition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The results of the first years of transition were uneven. All countries suffered high inflation and major recessions as prices were freed and old economic linkages broke down. But the scale of output losses and the time taken for growth to return and inflation to be brought under control varied widely. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="roaf2014">(Roaf et al. <a href="#ref-roaf2014">2014</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The Iron Law of Evaluation: “The expected value of any net impact assessment of any large scale social program is zero.” <span class="citation" data-cites="rossi1987">(Rossi <a href="#ref-rossi1987">1987</a>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Or even just the knowledge that debate about relatively simple questions of economic policy like the minimum wage seems interminable. For example, in a 2013 IGM Forum poll of academic economists 32% agreed and 34% disagreed with the statement, “Raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment.” <span class="citation" data-cites="igm_min_wage">(“Minimum Wage” <a href="#ref-igm_min_wage">2013</a>)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<p>I’ll pretend that list was a <em>tour de force</em> and you’re now on my side. If <em>The Singapore Story</em> indeed makes things sound easy though they’re in actual fact brutally difficult, we’re left with a puzzle. Some potential solutions include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Development isn’t easy in general but is if you’re Lee Kuan Yew.</li>
<li>Development isn’t easy in general but is if [some other special circumstance].</li>
<li>Development isn’t easy. Lee Kuan Yew deceived himself. Singapore just got lucky and when we look to it as an exemplar we’re falling prey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a>.</li>
<li>Development isn’t easy. Lee Kuan Yew deceived us. The version of events he presents in the memoir is sanitized, simplified, summarized or otherwise filtered in a way that makes it seem easier than it actually was.</li>
</ol>
<p>There will surely be some solution 4 in whatever mix we ultimately decide on, but it’s hard to know how much without reading other sources. And that’s a bridge too far. Also, it seems plausible that there are no other widely available sources to contradict or corroborate many of the key claims in the memoir.</p>
<p>In future posts, we’ll examine <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/lky-deity-dude/">solution 1</a> and <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/exemplars-curse-singapore/">solution 3</a> using the text itself. If I’m feeling brash, I might also offer baseless speculation on 2 in some future post.</p>

<p>This number is very impressive and might lead you to wonder why we should pay any attention to Singapore at all; China is more populous (read: harder to govern) <em>and</em> has higher growth. The crucial consideration is that Singapore started and ended its growth richer: $6,506 → $46,659 versus China’s $228 → $4,560. Economists often expect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(economics)">richer countries to grow more slowly</a> because “poorer countries can replicate the production methods, technologies and institutions of developed countries”.

Using multiple regression, we can statistically control for this confound, thereby eliminating the direct relationship between ice cream sales and swimming pool deaths.</p>
<p>Now consider the following twist. Rather than directly observing recorded daily temperatures, suppose we obtain self-reported Likert ratings of subjectively perceived heat levels. […] Fig 2 illustrates what happens when the error-laden subjective heat ratings are used in place of the more precisely recorded daily temperatures.

    <updated>2018-06-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s opposite day! Instead of talking about the ideal, we’re going to talk about the anti-ideal—the worst of all possible worlds. I contend that, if ideal theory is useful, anti-ideal theory is also useful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/ideal-calibration/">Last time</a>, we covered two roles for ideal theory—ideal as destination and ideal as calibration. We’ll examine the anti-ideal from each perspective.</p>
<h1 id="ideal-as-destination">Ideal as destination</h1>
<p>To recapitulate, this line of thinking claims the ideal is useful because it provides a long-term goal and something to work toward. Symmetrically, the anti-ideal is useful because it provides a long-term anti-goal and something to avoid. We operationalize this as seeking to minimize the distance between our current world and the ideal and maximize the distance between our world and the anti-ideal.</p>
<p>This is where the symmetry breaks down. For most reasonable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a>, there is only one world with a minimum distance to the ideal—namely, the ideal itself. Depending on what we believe about the set of possible worlds, there might be none, one or many points which are at a maximum distance from the anti-ideal.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>A physical analogy may help your intuition. If the ideal is the attractive pole of a magnet, drawing us toward it, the anti-ideal is the repulsive pole of a magnet. If we place an iron ball bearing in a ring surrounding the repulsive pole, any position on the edge of the ring is (subject to the constraints imposed by the ring) at a maximum distance from the repulsive pole.</p>
<p>So the anti-ideal isn’t as useful as the ideal in terms of orientation but it still is useful. Some illustrative scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are two viable routes to the ideal, but one passes perilously close to the anti-ideal and one doesn’t, we should take the latter. (We suppose that our social engineering skills are imperfect so that skirting the anti-ideal entails some non-zero risk of accidentally falling into it.)</li>
<li>If there’s not one unique maximum value (ideal) but several, we might well prefer to break the tie by picking the one farthest from the anti-ideal. Again, this minimizes the risk of catastrophe.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ideal-as-calibration">Ideal as calibration</h1>
<p>I think the argument for the anti-ideal is more compelling here. Last time, we said that given our imperfect knowledge of possible worlds and of justice, we can treat the social engineering problem of finding the best problem as a problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">statistical inference</a>. When inferring the true distribution of possible worlds, a maximum (the ideal) is useful data and can shift our estimates substantially. Symmetrically, the minimum (the anti-ideal) also helps us better understand the distribution of possible worlds.</p>
<p>Knowing only our own neighborhood of possible worlds as determined by those we’ve experienced is a very limited perspective. Envisioning the ideal helps us understand what we have to gain through change; envisioning the anti-ideal helps us understand what we have to lose.</p>
<p>Even more simply: More information about the distribution is better.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/utopia-infinitude-secretaries/">Last time</a>, I described how <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span> juxtaposes unidimensional and multidimensional models of justice. I went on to contest the claim that the ideal is otiose in the unidimensional model and made an analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">the secretary problem</a>.</p>
<p>This time I’ll make the (related) argument directly that there are two distinct uses of ideal theorizing and only one is bad from the unidimensional perspective.</p>
<h1 id="dimensionality-of-justice">Dimensionality of justice</h1>
<p>Let’s try to formalize ‘unidimensional’ and ‘multidimensional’ models of justice so we can be sure we’re thinking of the same thing. Gaus suggests (and I’ll accept) that a key part of any theory of ideal justice includes a function <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(e \colon \mathbb{W} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, a set of possible worlds <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{W}\)</span>. In other words, each such theory should be able to assign a ‘justice score’ to every possible world. In terms of this machinery, the unidimensional model simply limits itself to using <em>only</em> <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{W}\)</span>. The multidimensional model on the other hand also gives us a tool to inspect the structure of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{W}\)</span> in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metric</a> <span class="math inline">\(d \colon \mathbb{W} \times \mathbb{W} \to [0,\inf)\)</span>. In other words, the multidimensional model lets us determine how similar two possible worlds are in some way that’s not directly related to their justice scores.</p>
<p>To actually use this in a model, we’ll also need a way of finding worlds <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{W}\)</span> to evaluate. We denote a a random, ‘nearby’ (i.e. one with a small distance <span class="math inline">\(d(W, W_c)\)</span> from the then-current world <span class="math inline">\(W_c\)</span>) world as <span class="math inline">\(W_r\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="ideal-as-destination">Ideal as destination</h1>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span> and the rest of the literature suggest that the an ideal is useful as a destination. According to Rawls, “By showing how the social world may realize the features of a realistic Utopia, political philosophy provides a long-term goal of political endeavor, and in working toward it gives meaning to what we can do today.” <span class="citation" data-cites="rawls1993">(Rawls <a href="#ref-rawls1993">1993</a>)</span></p>
<p>In terms of our model, the ideal is <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_{W \in \mathbb{W}} e(W) = W_i\)</span>, the possible world that achieves the highest justice score. A wholly naive algorithm would then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use our ideal <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span> to orient societal progress by always picking <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}\limits_{W \in \{W_c, W_r\}} d(W, W_i) = W_{bk}\)</span>. In other words, on every ‘step’, someone proposes some random alternative world <span class="math inline">\(W_r\)</span> and this naive algorithm compares it to the current world and picks whichever is closer to the ideal.</li>
<li>Stop when <span class="math inline">\(d(W_c, W_i) = 0\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this interpretation, it’s clear that the ideal as destination as not only otiose in the unidimensional model but nonsensical. The unidimensional perspective was defined by its omission of the metric <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> so we certainly can’t use it in our algorithm to find <span class="math inline">\(W_{bk}\)</span>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="ideal-as-calibration">Ideal as calibration</h1>
<p>But, as we suggested in the previous post, this is not the only role that an ideal can play. In real life, we are not so perfectly informed as the simple mathematical model suggests. We can model our ignorance as some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge only of some proper subset of possible worlds: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{W}_k \subset \mathbb{W}\)</span></li>
<li>An inability to evaluate the justice of some alternative worlds. That is, our function is partial: <span class="math inline">\(e_p \colon \mathbb{W} ⇸ \mathbb{R}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The best world we know of is then <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_{W \in \mathbb{W}_k} e_p(W) = W_{bk}\)</span>. Also, there is some cost to exploring possible worlds—if nothing else, the opportunity cost of living in worse worlds.</p>
<h2 id="unidimensional">Unidimensional</h2>
<p>With this understanding in place, we can construct a naive algorithm just like the earlier one we described for the unidimensional case.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use our ideal <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span> to orient societal progress by always picking <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits{W \in \{W_c, W_r\}} e(W) = W_{bk}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Stop when <span class="math inline">\(e(W_c) = e(W_i)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We see that knowledge of the ideal is crucial in our stopping condition. Without it, it would be hard to determine when to stop the search and stop incurring search costs.</p>
<p>But we could still make a best guess about whether to stay or go, even without knowledge of the ideal. We can treat it as a problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">statistical inference</a>. We have a sample of possible worlds (the worlds we’ve experienced) and would like to estimate the true distribution of possible worlds. Once we have an estimate as to the distribution of possible worlds, we can make a more informed decision on whether to continue striving or to accept the status quo.</p>
<p>For example, if we’ve experienced many mediocre worlds in the past and only a few that are nearly as good as <span class="math inline">\(W_{bk}\)</span> <span id="in-upper-spark" class="spark"></span> (and if we, for the sake of expository convenience, suppose that possible worlds are normally distributed with respect to justice score), we should suspect that we’re in the upper tail of the distribution and be correspondingly cautious. Contrariwise, if we’ve experienced a few bad worlds in the past and many worlds about as good as ours <span id="in-middle-spark" class="spark"></span>, we should suspect that we’re in the fattest part of the distribution and that there’s still substantial room for improvement.</p>
<p>So even though the ideal isn’t absolutely necessary to provide a stopping condition in the unidimensional case, it is useful. Extrema have an outsize influence on our estimate of the distribution of possible worlds. If we’ve only experienced a handful of mediocre worlds <span id="mediocre-spark" class="spark"></span>, we might suppose that distribution of possible worlds is mediocre. If however, we learn of an ideal world that is far, far better <span id="ideal-spark" class="spark"></span>, our estimate of the distribution changes and so our actions should change accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="multidimensional">Multidimensional</h2>
<p>We can even transport this calibration logic back to the multidimensional perspective. The most interesting task in this setting is demonstrating that ideal as calibration is distinct from ideal as destination: First, suppose we lack an ideal theory and currently occupy a local maximum. If we’re sufficiently uncertain about the underlying distribution of possible worlds, our social engineering algorithm may well suggest we abandon this peak in search of higher peaks. We may even eventually end up at the true ideal (global maximum). Now, imagine that we <em>do</em> have an ideal theory, but it says that the ideal is only the teensiest smidge better than our current local maximum. Because traversing the landscape of possible worlds is costly, our algorithm almost certainly suggests that we stay at our current peak indefinitely. In other words, knowledge of the ideal has <em>discouraged</em> us from pursuing it. It has dictated that we stay where we are rather than pursue the ideal. This is impossible to explain if the ideal <em>only</em> has value as a destination.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The ideal can indeed serve as destination (i.e. we continually move toward the ideal). But it can also serve as calibration. Once we acknowledge our ignorance of possible worlds, we must treat the task of social engineering as a problem of statistical inference. From the statistical inference perspective, the ideal (maximum) is very informative about the underlying distribution of possible worlds and helps us make more informed trade-offs.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideals-as-superfluous">Ideals as superfluous</h1>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span>, the author lays out two conflicting views of political philosophy. The <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#IdeNonIdeThe">ideal theorists</a> insist on the value of having an ideal society in mind when deciding between possible futures. Their opponents, represented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen">Amartya Sen</a>, suggest this is a bit silly.</p>
<blockquote>
The possibility of having an identifiably perfect alternative does not indicate that it is necessary, or indeed useful, to refer to it in judging the relative merits of two alternatives; for example, we may be willing to accept, with great certainty, that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, completely unbeatable in terms of stature by any other peak, but that understanding is neither needed, nor particularly helpful, in comparing the peak heights of, say, Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount McKinley. There would be something off in the general belief that a comparison of any two alternatives cannot be sensibly made without a prior identification of a supreme alternative. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="sen2011">(Sen <a href="#ref-sen2011">2011</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>(The mountain climbing metaphor is popular in discussions of ideal theory.)</p>
<p>Gaus goes on to characterize Sen’s perspective as fundamentally unidimensional. He concludes the discussion with the following, “In this book, then, I shall explore multidimensional ways of thinking about justice, for they provide the most compelling response to Sen’s elegant unidimensional analysis—an analysis that makes the ideal otiose.”</p>
<h1 id="counterclaim">Counterclaim</h1>
<p>But I, random Internet blogger, claim they are both wrong. Or, at a minimum, very misleading. The ideal serves a role even from the unidimensional perspective.</p>
<p>Implicitly, they are both modeling the unidimensional search for a better world as one across a known set of worlds with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order">well-order</a> guiding the way. But this assumes too much. Even if we (unrealistically) suppose we can flawlessly evaluate each world or pair of worlds, we do not know the full set of possible worlds. Rather than perfect information, we are in a state of relative ignorance, groping in the dark. Given our ignorance, any information about the distribution of possible worlds (including the maximum—the ideal) is valuable.</p>
<h2 id="secretary-problem">Secretary problem</h2>
<p>To see that distributional information is valuable even in a unidimensional context, we’ll model ideal theory as a classic unidimensional problem: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">the secretary problem</a>. In this problem, an employer wants to hire a secretary and starts to interview applicants. After each interview, the employer can decide to continue interviewing or hire the last interviewee and end the process. Their goal is to stop optimally so that they hire the best possible applicant.</p>
<p>The crucial consideration for us is that the employer doesn’t know in advance the quality of the best secretary in the applicant pool. After each interview, the employer must decide if this is as good as it gets or whether to gamble by continuing on. If the employer knew in advance what the best applicant looked like, the problem would be trivial—just keep interviewing until you reach the best applicant.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3 id="better-fidelity">Better fidelity</h3>
<p>Of course, the classic secretary problem isn’t a perfect model of our social engineering problem. But we can extend it so it matches better:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="secretaries">
<ol type="1">
<li>We stipulate that it’s impossible to be without a secretary. There’s always a secretary currently at work who the employer can replace after a successful interview.</li>
<li>There’s no guarantee that an applicant will accept the employer’s offer.</li>
<li>The current set of applicants depends on the current secretary. (Think of it as the prestige of the employer, if that helps.)</li>
<li>There’s always an infinite number of secretaries applying.</li>
<li>The ongoing hiring process is costly.</li>
<li>Interviews aren’t as informative as actually working with a secretary.</li>
<li>The employer can attempt to rehire a former secretary.</li>
<li>A near optimal secretary is nearly as good as an optimal secretary.</li>
</ol>
</div><div class="ideal">
<ol type="1">
<li>We’re always living in <em>some</em> world with all the benefits and costs that entails.</li>
<li>There’s no guarantee that an attempted transition to some alternate world will succeed.</li>
<li>Reachable worlds are subject to feasibility constraints that depend on our current world.</li>
<li>From any given world, there’s an infinite number of possible futures.</li>
<li>We don’t have alternate worlds just presented to us on a platter. We must search and act to make them a real possibility.</li>
<li>Our predictions of the quality of some possible world are imperfect. We learn new things once we actually live in a given world.</li>
<li>We can attempt to return to some previous world.</li>
<li>A nearly ideal world (Nearly ideal in the sense of being of similar quality—not in the sense of being structurally similar to the ideal world.) is nearly as good as an optimal world.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="implications">Implications</h3>
<ul>
<li>2, 7, and 8 together mean that there’s a real cost to attempted transitions which ought to be weighed against the possible long-term benefits.</li>
<li>5 suggests that we should have some justification for continued search.</li>
<li>6 means that Sen’s naive approach of simply comparing options without context would fall victim to the optimizer’s curse. <span class="citation" data-cites="smith2006">(Smith and Winkler <a href="#ref-smith2006">2006</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Altogether, our model makes it clear that having some idea as to the best possible outcome is quite valuable. In other words, having an ideal society in mind is useful for political philosophy, even from the unidimensionalist’s perspective (supposing that conceivability <em>is</em> a guide to possibility <span class="citation" data-cites="yablo1993">(Yablo <a href="#ref-yablo1993">1993</a>)</span>). It helps us know what is possible and so helps us know when to stop striving.</p>
<p>Let’s be a bit more concrete. Suppose we had no ideal in mind and could only guess as to the quality of available secretaries. It would be quite hard to know when to quit and when to continue the search. Even if we think there are better secretaries out there, we may be wrong. And since we have only a weak sense of the overall distribution, we don’t know how much we have to lose when wrong and how much to gain when right.</p>
<p>Now, suppose instead that we know how good the best possible secretary is. Our decision process becomes easier. When we are far from the ideal, we know that we have much to gain and should be bold. As we near the ideal, we know that we have much to lose and little to gain so we should be cautious.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>If your ultimate goal is to climb a very tall mountain, knowing the height of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest">Everest</a> helps you determine when to keep pushing on to new peaks (because it turns out the mountain you’re currently on isn’t very tall when measured against Everest) and when to dig in at the current peak (because it turns out the mountain you’re currently on is almost as tall as Everest).</p>

<blockquote>
Multiple-choice questions are in turn of many kinds; usually they are presented in homogeneous groups. Sometimes a series of statements follows the reading exercise, and the person being tested is asked to indicate which statement best expresses the main idea or ideas of the passage read. In other cases the reader may be offered a choice of statements about a detail in the text, only one of which is a valid interpretation of the text, or at least is more apt than the others; or it may be the other way around; one is an incorrect choice, and the others are correct. Or a verbatim quotation may be given from the text to discover whether the reader has taken note of it and remembered it. Sometimes, in a statement either quoted directly or simply drawn from the text the reader will find a blank indicating that one or more words that will make sense of the statement have been omitted. Then follows a list of choices, lettered or numbered, among which the person being tested is asked to choose the phrase that, when inserted in the blank, best completes the statement.
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Yes, that’s 200 words explaining what multiple-choice questions are. If you’d like 426 more pages of mildly condescending prose explaining the obvious, boy, do I have a book for you. Mortimer J. Adler’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book"><em>How to Read a Book</em></a> is saved from the appellation ‘worst publication of 1940’ only due to stiff competition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Whom_God_Should_Not_Have_Created:_Persians,_Jews,_and_Flies">Ba’ath propagandists</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Here is a good chunk of the book’s actual content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main questions you must ask about any book.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the book about as a whole? […]</li>
<li>What is being said in detail, and how? […]</li>
<li>Is the book true, in whole or part? […]</li>
<li>What of it? […]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And the rules for analytical reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.</li>
<li>State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.</li>
<li>Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.</li>
<li>Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve.</li>
<li>Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.</li>
<li>Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.</li>
<li>Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.</li>
<li>Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.</li>
<li>Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”)</li>
<li>Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.</li>

<li>Show wherein the author is misinformed.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author is illogical.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete.</li>

<p>Almost nothing valuable is lost in this abbreviation. The meaning of each point is simply the most obvious meaning you’d guess from the summary here and the author provides little special insight.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I’m sure Adler would wag his finger at this review for failing to follow his rules of fair criticism. But Adler also says (in his characteristically prolix way—never use one word where a dozen will do):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too often, there are things we have to read that are not really worth spending a lot of time reading; if we cannot read them quickly, it will be a terrible waste of time. It is true enough that many people read some things too slowly, and that they ought to read them faster. But many people also read some things too fast, and they ought to read those things more slowly. A good speed reading course should therefore teach you to read at many different speeds, not just one speed that is faster than anything you can manage now. It should enable you to vary your rate of reading in accordance with the nature and complexity of the material.</p>
<p>Our point is really very simple. Many books are hardly worth even skimming; some should be read quickly; and a few should be read at a rate, usually quite slow, that allows for complete comprehension. It is wasteful to read a book slowly that deserves only a fast reading; speed reading skills can help you solve that problem. But this is only one reading problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I’m mad for having <span class="noted">wasted as much time</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as I already have on this book. It does not, in my opinion, merit more serious engagement.</p>
<h1 id="postscript">Postscript</h1>
<p>If you look at Amazon reviews, there are a <em>lot</em> of five star reviews of this book. Evidently, some people have found value in it. If you’re not sure whether to believe me or the many Amazon reviewers, it may benefit you to skip directly to Appendix B (Exercises and tests at the four levels of reading). Only proceed to the body of the book if you have trouble with the exercises there.</p>

<p>Perhaps I really did need to read this book if I wasn’t able to judge it a waste of time more expeditiously? No. I granted it the benefit of the doubt due to strong recommendations from people whose judgement I otherwise trust.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been talking about autocrats lately. It’d be good if we could put our new understanding to use. In that spirit, here are a couple of constructive schemes.</p>
<h1 id="retirement-plans">Retirement plans</h1>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> describe the difficulties an autocracy faces in the voluntary relinquishment of power:</p>
<blockquote>
A similar problem plagues the reverse solution, whereby the dictator agrees to a voluntary transition to democracy in return for some transfers in the future to compensate him for the lost income and privileges. Those who will benefit from a transition to democracy would be willing to make such promises, but once the dictator relinquishes his political power, there is no guarantee that citizens would agree to tax themselves in order to make payments to this former dictator. Promises of compensation to a former dictator are typically not credible.
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>
<p>If, as proposed in <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/mo-money-mo-problems-autocrat-remix/">the previous post</a>, autocrats would prefer a guarantee of somewhat reduced income to a chance of somewhat greater income, this transition would be a Pareto improvement. The autocrat gets stability and in exchange the people suffer less expropriation/taxation. So indeed, the only problem is one of commitment.</p>
<p>We can solve this problem by moving ‘up a level’. The citizens of any particular country can’t credibly commit to honoring such an agreement. But if we turn the one-shot game into an repeated game by asking an international organization (e.g. the UN) to facilitate and enforce all such agreements, we create a new equilibrium. The UN (or another international org) would have an incentive to honor these agreements because their credibility when it comes to future such agreements relies on their past behavior.</p>
<p>To be slightly more concrete: The UN creates a new program, Retirement Early Autocrat Program (it got mangled in the translation from French). Every year, REAP diplomats go around to autocracies and convene autocrats and a sortition of citizens. At the conventions, they attempt to negotiate a deal—the autocrat peacefully retires in exchange for an income of $X in perpetuity. If the deal doesn’t go through, the REAPers leave and try again next year. If the deal is struck, REAPers take care of logistics (the autocrat should probably go into comfortable exile) and ensure the agreed upon payment is collected and delivered. If either party tries to renege on the agreement, the REAPers say, “No!”, and bring some enforcement mechanism to bear. They know that if they don’t, their whole program loses credibility and purpose.</p>
<h2 id="political-feasibility">Political feasibility</h2>
<p>Their are obvious political problems here. If a country refuses to honor their agreement, REAP is put in the position of sanctioning, occupying or otherwise penalizing a country with the intent of restoring a dictator to riches. This is politically unpalatable to say the least and so credible enforcement of this side of the bargain is difficult.</p>
<p>Workarounds include requiring prepayment (i.e. the country purchases an annuity for their dictator, presumably backed by REAP) and third parties subsidizing or entirely financing the agreement. It seems plausible that such agreements would often be less than the cost of military intervention which third parties are sometimes willing to undertake.</p>
<p>For example, direct war appropriations (a dramatic underestimate of the full cost) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#Financial_cost">Iraq War</a> total $819 billion to date <span class="citation" data-cites="crawford2017">(Crawford <a href="#ref-crawford2017">2017</a>)</span>. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Sadam Hussein</a> had been expected to live to the ripe age of 96, this $819 billion would have purchased <span class="noted">an annuity paying around $56 billion a year</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In 2003, the total GDP of Iraq was around $30 billion <span class="citation" data-cites="cia2004">(CIA <a href="#ref-cia2004">2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> had been expected to live to 95, the $1.1 billion incurred by the US during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya#Costs">intervention in Libya</a> (maybe a third of the total spending by all foreign powers) would have purchased an annuity paying out a more modest $81 million per year <span class="citation" data-cites="zenko2011">(Zenko <a href="#ref-zenko2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Even this approach of third-party funding has political problems. It smacks of the dreaded Appeasement and so might be disfavored when compared to military intervention even if a bargain.</p>
<h2 id="trust-your-gut">Trust your gut</h2>
<p>Outside of political feasibility, is this scheme plausible? I admit that I don’t expect there’s a price at which each and every autocrat can be bought. There are non-pecuniary perks to power. But I also find it somewhat unlikely that <em>no</em> autocrat can be bought.</p>
<h2 id="unintended-consequences">Unintended consequences</h2>
<p>One drawback to this approach is that in addition to incentivizing abdication, it might incentivize individuals to seek autocratic power in the first place. This is a hard trade-off to escape. My only mitigation is behavioral economics and psychology seem to suggest that people underweight temporally distant and doubtful consequences when compared to immediate consequences. That means this scheme is likely more effective at encouraging abdication (the retirement plan is immediate) than encouraging the ascent to power (the retirement plan is distant and doubtful).</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related work</h2>
<p>Many others sing the praises of making safe retirement a possibility for autocrats. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
[A] hardline approach is too simplistic, and may prolong crises by discouraging autocratic leaders from leaving office lest they face prosecution. […] [P]resenting autocrats with a face-saving alternative to clinging to power might even save lives, because they would then have “less reason to be severely oppressive”. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="partridge2011">(Partridge <a href="#ref-partridge2011">2011</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dictators try to hang on until the bitter end because they love power and wealth […]. Unquestionably, though, there have been instances in which tyrants have resisted relinquishing the reins of power simply for lack of a reasonably safe haven to protect them from retaliation by those they have oppressed.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>What happens when a dictator finds it hard to leave because he has no place to go? One result is increased repression, as ever harsher steps prove necessary to crush or harass impatient local opponents.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Given the limits of diplomacy, persuasion and foreign intervention, the world community should establish a formal machinery for facilitating the voluntary retirement of dictators. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="fidell1986">(Fidell <a href="#ref-fidell1986">1986</a>)</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposal advanced here only differs in that it also proposes funding such retirements to provide a positive incentive for abdication.</p>
<h1 id="justice-and-incentives">Justice and incentives</h1>
<p>Discussions in this area like those cited above and like <span class="citation" data-cites="bosco2017">(Bosco <a href="#ref-bosco2017">2017</a>)</span> often end up talking about the perverse impact of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court">International Criminal Court</a>. In trying to ensure that autocrats are held accountable for atrocities, the ICC may actually encourage autocrats to cling to power. When in power, autocrats are relatively hard to prosecute. When out of power, they’re likely easier to prosecute.</p>
<p>A tension is then established between a deontological commitment to justice and providing autocrats with the right incentives. I think this conflict can mostly be dissolved by offering ‘credit’ for abdication. If the ICC would sentence a forcibly deposed autocrat with sentence X for their actions, that autocrat should receive sentence X - A in the case of voluntary abdication. Now, the autocrat is generally discouraged from committing atrocities and generally encouraged to abdicate. The only problem is if the credit cancels out the punishment entirely so that the autocrat gets some ‘freebie’ atrocities. The size of the credit should be carefully calibrated to account for this.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>obviously</em>, If you are the leader of a nation state or a powerful international organization, you shouldn’t just take any of this at face value. These are complex matters involving issues (beyond those already mentioned) of interventionism, parochialism, hubris, unintended consequences, etc.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>El-Materi’s house is spacious, and directly above and along the Hammamet public beach. The compound is large and well guarded by government security. It is close to the center of Hammamet, with a view of the fort and the southern part of the town. The house was recently renovated and includes an infinity pool and a terrace of perhaps 50 meters. While the house is done in a modern style (and largely white), there are ancient artifacts everywhere: Roman columns, frescoes and even a lion’s head from which water pours into the pool. El Materi insisted the pieces are real. He hopes to move into his new (and palatial) house in Sidi Bou Said in eight to ten months.</p>
<p>The dinner included perhaps a dozen dishes, including fish, steak, turkey, octopus, fish couscous and much more. The quantity was sufficient for a very large number of guests. Before dinner a wide array of small dishes were served, along with three different juices (including Kiwi juice, not normally available here). After dinner, he served ice cream and frozen yoghurt he brought in by plane from Saint Tropez, along with blueberries and raspberries and fresh fruit and chocolate cake. (NB. El Materi and Nesrine had just returned from Saint Tropez on their private jet after two weeks vacation. El Materi was concerned about his American pilot finding a community here. The Ambassador said he would be pleased to invite the pilot to appropriate American community events.)</p>
<p>El Materi has a large tiger (“Pasha”) on his compound, living in a cage. He acquired it when it was a few weeks old. The tiger consumes four chickens a day. (Comment: The situation reminded the Ambassador of Uday Hussein’s lion cage in Baghdad.) El Materi had staff everywhere. There were at least a dozen people, including a butler from Bangladesh and a nanny from South Africa. (NB. This is extraordinarily rare in Tunisia, and very expensive.)</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Even more extravagant is their home still under construction in Sidi Bou Said. That residence, from its outward appearance, will be closer to a palace. It dominates the Sidi Bou Said skyline from some vantage points and has been the occasion of many private, critical comments. The opulence with which El Materi and Nesrine live and their behavior make clear why they and other members of Ben Ali’s family are disliked and even hated by some Tunisians. The excesses of the Ben Ali family are growing. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="godec2009">(Godec <a href="#ref-godec2009">2009</a>)</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The epigraph here describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakher_El_Materi">son-in-law</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia">Tunisia</a>’s former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali">double threat prime minister and president</a> (read: autocrat). It seems that his connection to the ruler was enough for him to lead an incomparably opulent life. I contend that this fact may actually be key to the riddle we’ve been pondering recently about autocracies.</p>
<h1 id="explaining-autocratic-underachievement">Explaining autocratic underachievement</h1>
<h2 id="recapitulating">Recapitulating</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> suggests that stratified societies are at a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. There, they suggest that autocracies underperform inclusive societies because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Autocrats cannot commit to upholding economic rights essential for growth. Realizing this, producers ‘shirk’ and growth slows.</li>
<li>Autocrats block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks improvements</a> that disadvantage them.</li>
</ol>
<p>But when we examined these explanations we found them wanting:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/autocrats-accelerate-growth-cooperation/">First</a>, we built a game theoretic model which showed that, under the right conditions, a rational dictator could credibly commit to upholding certain economic rights because it’s in their long-term interest.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/inclusive-extractive-societies-each-structural-advantages/">Second</a>, we pointed out that, even in inclusive societies, there are blocs capable of blocking Kaldor-Hicks improvements.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="an-alternative-explanation">An alternative explanation</h2>
<p>We can resuscitate the second explanation by noting how pervasive it is.</p>
<p>If you’re the dictator of basically any country, you’re so materially wealthy that more money for personal consumption is close to pointless. Tunisia (from the epigraph) is not a wealthy country. Its per capita GDP is $3,553 and its total GDP is $40 billion putting it in 96th place out of 191 listed countries <span class="citation" data-cites="weod2017">(Fund <a href="#ref-weod2017">2017</a>)</span>. Yet the president’s son-in-law has a tiger named Pasha. I’m sure you could tell a similar story about North Korea.</p>
<p>Formalizing this somewhat, I’m suggesting that basically every dictator is in the region of their utility function where the marginal utility of more money is very small indeed. If we also suppose that increasing economic growth has some expected cost (most saliently, increased risk of deposition), autocrats’ reluctance to increase growth is quite rational. In symbols and sloppily, <span class="math inline">\(u(\Delta\$ + \$) \cdot (1 - (\Delta r + r)) &lt; u(\$) \cdot (1 - r)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the risk of deposition, <span class="math inline">\(u(\$)\)</span> is the utility from money, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\$\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> are the increased money and risk associated with some proposed reform.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-evidence">Empirical evidence</h2>
<p>This is all lovely theorizing, but is it actually true? We already (briefly) <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/minor-blessings-god-emperor/#empirical-evidence">examined the data</a> on the counterclaim that restraint is useful for dictators in the long-term and the data seemed supportive. To test the new explanation offered here (diminishing marginal utility) we might look at GDP and rapacity as measured by risk of expropriation (which seems to be the standard proxy in the literature). If there is a substantial anticorrelation when comparing these variables across countries and times, our new explanation would be less plausible (i.e. Anticorrelation could indicate that autocrats in smaller countries are more rapacious because they can’t be sated by the income available from more moderate rates of expropriation). Unfortunately, the data set that’s standard for these kinds of questions <span class="citation" data-cites="prs2004">(PRS Group and others <a href="#ref-prs2004">2004</a>)</span> is proprietary.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We’ve been wondering why stratified societies grow more slowly than inclusive societies. After challenging offered explanations in previous posts, we offered a new explanation. Perhaps dictators don’t seek economic growth because increased material wealth is basically pointless for the already obscenely wealthy.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="motivating-scenario">Motivating scenario</h1>
<p>Suppose you wanted to do the absolute <em>most</em> good you could. No satisficers here. (Of course, purely hypothetical. No one in these parts would have enough hubris to undertake such a monumental task. Surely.) You wouldn’t just luck into the right activity. It would probably require careful thinking and investigating many big, difficult problems. How do you deal with moral uncertainty? <span class="citation" data-cites="macaskill2014">(MacAskill <a href="#ref-macaskill2014">2014</a>)</span> Which moral theory should you grant the most credence? What are all the possible do-gooding interventions? What are their unintended consequences?</p>
<p>If you insisted upon answering all these questions before acting, you’d almost surely die before you finished. My intuition suggests that’s not the right balance that actually optimizes impact. You should probably act in the world at some point rather than idly noodle until the reaper visits. But when? One possibility is to just pick a semi-arbitrary date on the calendar—to timebox, if you can stomach the business jargon.</p>
<p>Can you do better than this? Can you come up with a more principled way to transition from investigation to action? I contend that the answer is “Yes” and that the tool is value of information calculations.</p>
<h1 id="expected-value-of-information-calculation">Expected value of information calculation</h1>
<h2 id="simple-scenario">Simple scenario</h2>
<p>We’ll now look at a much simpler domain for expository purposes. Suppose a friend came to you and offered you a dollar if you called their coin flip correctly. As long as they didn’t charge you, it would make sense to agree as you’d expect to win 50 cents on average. Even better would be if you could swap out their coin with your own trusty <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHeadedCoin">two-headed coin</a>. Then, you could be certain that you’d make the right call and you’d get the dollar every time. The extra information you get by knowing the outcome has value.</p>
<h2 id="expected-value-of-perfect-information">Expected value of perfect information</h2>
<p>Slightly less obvious is that you can believe information is valuable to you without being certain exactly what that information is. Suppose you were unable to swap out the flipper’s coin, but a trustworthy friend came to you and whispered, “I know that the flipper uses a two-sided coin. How much will you pay me to tell you whether it’s double heads or double tails?”. After some thinking, I hope you’ll agree that you’d gain by paying up to 50 cents for this information. Without the information you expect to earn 50 cents from the flipper’s bargain. With the information, you expect to earn a dollar. If your friend tells you that it’s a two-headed coin, you can simply bet on heads. If they tell you it’s a two-tailed coin, bet on tails. Either way, you’re guaranteed the dollar. As long as you can react accordingly via your bet, you should be willing to pay for this unknown information. Paying, for example, 20 cents would still leave you ahead because your net gain from the whole transaction would be 80 cents.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="expected-value-of-imperfect-information">Expected value of imperfect information</h2>
<p>“But I can’t believe my susurrous friend unreservedly and still hold my head high at the local fallibilist’s meetings!”, you object. Right you are. Even if your friend’s whispers don’t leave you 100% certain about what kind of coin the flipper has, we can still apply the same logic from before. The arithmetic is just a bit more complicated. Ultimately, the conclusion that reducing our uncertainty can have value—even without knowing in which direction the uncertainty will be reduced—remains intact.</p>
<h2 id="other-explanations">Other explanations</h2>
<p>If you’d like an alternative exposition with more details and some accompanying graphics, I think these are both pretty good: <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~kirkwood/DAStuff/decisiontrees/DecisionTreePrimer-3.pdf">The Value of Information</a>, <a href="http://treeplan.com/chapters/value-of-information-in-decision-trees.pdf">Value of Information in Decision Trees</a>.</p>
<h1 id="calculator">Calculator</h1>
<p>But you might not need to understand the details of the calculation laid out in those links because I provide a handy dandy value of information calculator for you here.</p>
<p>The input required by the calculator is a tree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML format</a>. The top level of the tree describes the different pieces of information you might find (e.g. the coin is double heads) after investigating and how likely you think each piece of information is. Each of these info nodes has children corresponding to actions you might take (e.g. bet heads). The final level of the tree (the children of the action nodes) describe the outcomes that actually occur and their probability of occurrence given the information received.</p>
<p>So the default tree entered below describes the coin flip scenario described above when you have no clue as to which two-sided coin is in use and you believe your susurrous friend is absolutely reliable.</p>
<p>In addition to showing the expected value of information, the calculator shows the corresponding simplified scenario in which you have no way of gaining information about outcomes at the bottom. For example, it shows you the original coin flip scenario before your susurrous friend comes along. This is offered simply as a point of comparison.</p>

If true, this is quite important; it suggests that, in the long run, we should expect inclusive societies to “win” out. The moral arc of the universe bends toward justice and all that.</p>
<h1 id="oligarchs-favor-stability-over-growth">Oligarchs favor stability over growth</h1>
<p>But is it true? As far as I can tell, the best articulation of this claim is in section 6 of <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>. It lays out several claims in support of the argument that oligarchic societies have a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/autocrats-accelerate-growth-cooperation/">Last time</a>, we examined their first claim and found it wanting. In this post, we’ll focus on the second:</p>
<blockquote>
Another related source of inefficient economic institutions arises from the desire of political elites to protect their political power. [..] [T]he political elite should evaluate every potential economic change not only according to its economic consequences, such as its effects on economic growth and income distribution, but also according to its political consequences. […] Fearing these potential threats to their political power, the elites may oppose changes in economic institutions that would stimulate economic growth.
</blockquote>
<p>I have no problems with this claim in itself.</p>
<h1 id="invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies-again">Invidious majoritarian tyrannies, again</h1>
<p>But I think it tells an incomplete story. It’s not the case that social efficiency can only be impeded by minorities in oligarchic societies. Societies with inclusive institutions can also user their decision-making process to block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks improvements</a>. If a majority weakly prefers A to B while a minority strongly prefers B to A, majority voting will choose A even though this doesn’t necessarily maximize social welfare. This is precisely the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/innocuous-invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies">invidious tyranny of the majority we talked about before</a>. An oligarchic society could well avoid this problem.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="collective-action-problems">Collective action problems</h1>
<p>I think it’s fair to gloss Acemoglu and Robinson’s ‘inclusive’ and ‘extractive’ as societies with, respectively, many agents and few agents when it comes to making important political decisions. In this case, we should expect inclusive societies to have more numerous and more serious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">problems of collective action</a>. At the most extreme—autocracy, there can be no coordination problems at the highest levels of power.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Of course, these counterarguments also aren’t definitive. For example, taking advantage of the structural benefits of oligarchy requires fairly sophisticated oligarchs.</p>
<p>But these considerations do change the overall picture. Instead of saying that stratified societies are at a pure disadvantage to inclusive societies and inclusive societies are thus destined to win out, we see that each has structure has advantages and disadvantages. It comes down to an empirical question about which set of advantages is more important in practice.</p>

<p>Earlier, I <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">suggested that there are multiple interpretations of preference utilitarianism available</a>, and <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">outlined the implications of a few</a>. Now, we’ll clarify how this whole line of thinking relates to existing discussion because context is good.</p>
<h1 id="value-based-on-preferences"><em>Value based on preferences</em></h1>
<p>At first, I thought this paper might be detailing exactly the same thing I have here. However, further reading leads me to believe that they’re addressing something more like a secular version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma">Euthyphro dilemma</a>. Do we prefer good things because they are good? Or are good things good because they’re preferred? This issue is distinct from the one we’ve examined here.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="misguided-preferences">Misguided preferences</h1>
<p>Some object to preference utilitarianism because preferences can be “misinformed, crazy, horrendous, or trivial” <span class="citation" data-cites="sep-consequentialism">(Sinnott-Armstrong <a href="#ref-sep-consequentialism">2015</a>)</span>. This objection and its responses also deal with an error (loosely conceived) in the overall scheme of preference utilitarianism. But the error here is in the preference itself which is distinct from the preferrer’s beliefs about the world. To see that these are indeed distinct: Imagine someone with complete and total amnesia. They may well prefer certain states of the world to others but have no beliefs about the world at all because of their (philosophically convenient) thoroughgoing amnesia.</p>
<h1 id="nozicks-experience-machine">Nozick’s experience machine</h1>
<p>Nozick’s experience machine is the most similar to our line of thinking here <span class="citation" data-cites="nozick2013">(Nozick <a href="#ref-nozick2013">2013</a>)</span>. It also examines a case where our beliefs about the world diverge from the fact of the matter. However, Nozick mostly uses the rhetorical device to argue that PPU (in our terminology) is an impoverished notion of the good. Virtues matter, rights matter, etc. We’ve instead examined MPU as an answer to the problem posed by the experience machine and looked at the whole issue in more detail. In other words, Nozick suggests the problem might be fixed by considering more than just preferences when determining the good and I’ve suggested the problem might be fixed by adjusting when we regard a preference as fulfilled.</p>

    <title>Preference utilitarianism—psychological or metaphysical? II</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">Last time</a> we highlighted that there are actual several possible interpretations of preference utilitarianism. These depend on when you get to a recognize a preference as having been satisfied in your moral accounting: When the world changes to accord with your preference? When you believe the world to have changed? When you have a justified true belief that the world has changed?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll draw out some implications of these views which will also serve as preliminary arguments for and against. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on the two poles: preferences are satisfied when the preferrer believes the world to have changed (purely psychological), and preferences are satisfied when the world has changed (purely metaphysical).</p>
<p>(I’ll also note that I assume advocates of preference utilitarianism implicitly (or explicitly and silently?) believe the psychological variant and my intuition favors it. If I argue against that position more vehemently, it’s only a sign of esteem.)</p>
<h1 id="psychological">Psychological</h1>
<h2 id="deception">Deception</h2>
<p>One obvious but unfortunate implication of the psychological point of view is that self-deception is A-OK. Obligatory even. If I’d like to be create a grand unified theory of physics, I may find it easier to set myself a bastardized version of the problem than to solve the real thing. And if I can deceive myself in this way, the psychological theory of preference utilitarianism (henceforth PPU) makes a prima facie case that I am morally obliged to. (Because this deceptive approach is easier, it means I can satisfy this preference quickly and move on the satisfaction of other preferences rather than sinking vast gobs of time into the ‘authentic’ method.)</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But it’s not just self-deception. It’s any and all deception. Suppose I want to be loved by my family. If I’m a bit of git, my family might judge that just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gaslighting</a> me into believing I already am is easier and more likely to succeed than going through the hard personal and interpersonal work of improvement. Again, they may even be morally obliged to gaslight me. Similarly, depending on circumstances, a polity might be morally obliged to wage an effective propaganda campaign denying the presence of poverty rather than actually solving it. We’ve reached peak Orwell already.</p>
<p><!-- One response is that people might have second-order preferences that their preferences are *actually* satisfied---that is, that the world is in accord with their preferences. But this is little help for PPU; it only moves the problem one level up. Now, in addition to an incentive to self-deceive, I have an incentive to choose a lax episteme. If I pick an episteme with low standards of evidence,  --> <!-- I will believe that this second-order preference is satisfied precisely when I believe that the first-order preference is satisfied. I will never simultaneously believe that the world is in state S in accordance with my first-order preference, but believe that my second-order preference has been frustrated because I merely falsely believe state S obtains. --></p>
<p>One reasonable response is that these deceptions are short-sighted. Satisfying these ‘gateway’ preferences might unlock new and better possibilities that are unavailable to the deceived. An actual grand unified theory of physics might allow things heretofore considered impossible.</p>
<p>But not all preferences are like this. Some are truly terminal. No further beliefs or actions are contingent upon their fulfillment in the world and so there is nothing that pragmatically militates for their accuracy. Being loved might be like this. I struggle to think of any further beliefs or actions that are only available to the truly loved and unavailable to those who are surrounded by committed gaslighters.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d rest uneasy if my only defense against being morally obliged to deceive was that it was sometimes pragmatically unwise. If a thing seems bad, it’s nice to have a principled way of avoiding it rather than hoping that contingent fact works in our favor.</p>
<h2 id="supervenience-lost">Supervenience lost</h2>
<p>At the end of the hazing, Broseph’s frat brother came back into the room and gave the CCTV a good ol’ Fonze thump. The colors shifted back and reflected the fact of the matter. “Bro, We got you <em>good</em>!. The TV had distorted colors. The M&amp;Ms actually started out mixed and he was sorting them into separate piles for each color. Psych!”</p>
<p>With Broseph’s new beliefs about what happened, his evaluation of the morality of the original M&amp;M shuffling has flipped. Furthermore, if you’d asked Broseph about returning the M&amp;Ms to their original position before the revelation, he’d have correctly said it was good (he believed it satisfied his preferences). Just after the revelation, he would also be correct in claiming that it was bad (he believed it frustrated his preferences). So under PPU, a single action can correctly be said to both right and wrong. That’s worrying because <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience-ethics/">supervenience</a> isn’t something to give up lightly.</p>
<p>The only way to retain supervenience is to contextualize each action in light of observers’ beliefs. For example, “Returning the M&amp;Ms to their original position is good <em>when</em> Broseph believes the CCTV and thus believes all the M&amp;Ms are the same color.” and “Returning to the M&amp;Ms to their original position is good <em>when</em> Broseph doubts the CCTV and thus believes all the resulting piles are different colors.”</p>
<p>This works, but it’s contrary to the plain language used when people make moral evaluations. If we want PPU and supervenience, we must interpret statements like “Action A is right.” as having a silent contextualizer: “I believe action A in the context of belief B is right.” This is a bit weird.</p>
<h2 id="anthropic-effects">Anthropic effects</h2>
<p>PPU also seems to imply that surprise, secret murders aren’t wrong. Even though we imagine most people have a preference for life, if they’re dead, there is no preferrer that’s frustrated. But this issue applies to any embodied ethic including, for example, hedonic utilitarianism so we won’t belabor it here.</p>
<h1 id="metaphysical">Metaphysical</h1>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>One benefit of PPU is that it ‘screens out’ the vast majority of preferrers. The preferences an actor must account for are precisely those of agents that will come to know about the action. On the other hand, metaphysical preference utilitarianism (henceforth MPU) commits us to caring about <em>all</em> preferences.</p>
<p>Suppose the frat brothers had cut the CCTV cable so Broseph was just sitting in an empty room staring at a blank TV. MPU implies the masked brother is still morally obliged to sort the M&amp;Ms—it brings the world into accord with Broseph’s preferences which is good even if Broseph doesn’t know about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are potentially many other humans on Earth with preferences about M&amp;M sorting. The masked brother ought to try to satisfy these as well. Satisfying these preferences with almost no information is quixotic, but I’ve typically found a “Just do your best!” reply to concerns about tractability issues in utilitarianism pretty satisfying.</p>
<p>Even stranger is the possibility that the masked brother might be obliged to account for preferences outside of his light cone. If an alien that cares about M&amp;M sorting lives on the edge of the universe such that the alien is outside of our light cone (i.e. we can never have any causal influence on it), the most obvious versions of MPU suggest that the masked brother should still account for these preferences.</p>
<p>And once you’ve opened the door to honoring preferrers who are causally isolated from the actor, it seems that you ought to honor the preferences of both past (i.e. the deceased) and future (i.e. the unborn) preferrers. This is both weird and a bit convenient because it provides a way to talk about <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-intergenerational/">intergenerational justice</a>.</p>
<h3 id="path-dependence">Path dependence</h3>
<p>If we accept the implication that past preferences have moral import for current actions, we’ve introduced path dependence. The same action can be correctly subject to different moral evaluations depending on past preferences. For example, if we’re in time 2 and indifferent between actions A and B, but someone in time 1 preferred action A, we ought to do A. On the other hand, if the person in time 1 preferred action B, we ought to do that. So our moral obligations in time 2 differ even if the preferrer in time 1 is now deceased and these two counterfactual worlds are identical at time 2. We’ve lost supervenience again.</p>
<h3 id="mistaken-preferences">Mistaken preferences</h3>
<p>Another bizarre consequence of honoring past preferences is that we might be obliged to honor our own past preferences that we now regard as mistaken. If our preferences are time-weighted (i.e. the longer a preference is held, the more weight it’s granted in our moral calculus), naive MPU suggests I’m morally obliged to honor an old, long-standing preference contrary to my current preferences until I’ve held the current preference long enough. That is, if I preferred action A to B for times 1-10, and start preferring action B at time 11, it is only morally permissible to undertake B from time 21 on.</p>
<h3 id="subconclusion">Subconclusion</h3>
<p>These concerns all suggest that we must be more selective in which preferences we regard as morally important—all preferences everywhere and everywhen quickly becomes baffling. It’s not enough to say that a preference is satisfied when the world comes into accord with it. There must be some further relationship between the preference and the world. But what is this demarcation criterion that doesn’t rely on psychology? Light cones?</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We’ve examined two possible interpretations of preference utilitarianism: psychological preference utilitarianism (the morally important part of preference satisfaction is when the preferrer believes it to be satisfied) and metaphysical preference utilitarianism (the morally important part of preference satisfaction is when the world comes into accord with the preference). Each has strange implications. PPU favors deception and gives up intuitive supervenience. MPU requires us to pick us some alternative, non-obvious demarcation criterion; the broadest possible demarcation criterion is a bad candidate.</p>
<p>Maybe the best solution is knowledge preference utilitarianism? Rather than the preferrer’s belief being the crucial ingredient, it’s knowledge—justified true belief.</p>]]></summary>

If a preference is satisfied in a forest and no one is around to witness it, is it good?
</blockquote>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Preference utilitarianism holds that the good a utilitarian ought to maximize is the satisfaction of preferences. Preferences exist in our mind, but (often) refer to the external world. Thus, the satisfaction of preferences must bridge this gap between the mind and the world. That is, if I have a preference for the world to be in a particular state which was once unsatisfied and that very preference is now satisfied, it must be because my beliefs about the world have changed. But beliefs about the world are the domain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a>. Preferences may then be the Trojan horse that smuggle the problems of epistemology into the already troubled camp of ethics.</p>
<h1 id="color-shifted-cctv">Color shifted CCTV</h1>
<p>Let’s try to make the issue a bit more vivid.</p>
<div class="skippable">
<p>Suppose, in his halcyon days, Broseph Raz attended The School for Convenient Philosophical Thought Experiments. At the school, they inculcated in him the sincere preference that M&amp;M’s must always be sorted by color. One group for blues, one for green, etc. During his sophomore year there, he pledged at the premier philosophical Greek fraternity on campus, ΣΟΦ. As part of the pledge process, he had to take part in their fiendishly thought-provoking hazing rituals:</p>
<!--more-->
<p>His frat brother lifted the blindfold, galumphed out of the room, and locked the door. All Broseph saw in the dusty room was a small CRT TV looking onto a table covered in green M&amp;Ms. Broseph hadn’t really understood the school’s M&amp;M obsession when he’d first matriculated, but he now had to admit it was pretty satisfying. Soon enough, his reveries were interrupted. A man in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gettier">Edmund Gettier</a> mask entered the frame and hovered a grubby hand over the pile. He turned to the camera and growled, “Don’t look away!”. Then he started splitting the pile M by M. One to the left, one to the right. One to the left, one to the right. Broseph gritted his teeth. But he looked on; he wouldn’t let his brothers down. The masked man continued. By now, more M&amp;Ms had been pushed out of the pile than were left behind; it would be over soon. Then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The masked man hadn’t even finished splitting the pile! There were three separate piles of green M&amp;Ms now. Broseph groaned as the masked man cackled and ducked out of the frame.</p>
<p>As the masked man left the Chamber of Trials, he pulled off his mask and was met with raucous guffaws. “Bro! That was rad.” High fives all around. “Dude, you killed it. Broseph had no idea.” “Browen, that was sick. You just took one good look at that mixed pile of M&amp;Ms and started sorting them. Reds with reds, greens with greens, blues with blues. No hesitation! But they all looked blue to Broseph! You should have seen his face. I was crying laughing, bro!”</p>
</div>
<h2 id="no-nonsense">No-nonsense</h2>
<p>Suppose someone prefers M&amp;Ms to be sorted by color. Now suppose they have a CCTV view onto a room with what appears to be a pile of green M&amp;Ms. The trick is that the CCTV shifts colors so they <em>all</em> appear to be green. The actual fact of the matter is that the pile is a riot of colors. Someone else comes into the room and sorts the M&amp;Ms by color. The fact of the matter is that the M&amp;Ms have gone from mixed to sorted (satisfying the spectator’s preferences), but the spectator perceives them to have gone from sorted to arbitrarily separated (frustrating the spectator’s preferences). Is what just happened good or bad?</p>
<h1 id="epistemology-in-your-ethics">Epistemology in your ethics</h1>
<p>The core problem then is this: I have preferences over states of the world. What part of satisfying those preferences does preference utilitarianism rate as morally important? Is the moral good obtained when the world changes or when I learn about the change in the world? And if it’s not about the world itself but about my state of mind, what precisely is morally important? Is it my beliefs, my true beliefs, my justified true beliefs?</p>
<p>To use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map and territory metaphor</a>: If I’d prefer the world to be otherwise, which is the important part? Are my preferences satisfied as far as preference utilitarianism is concerned when the territory changes? When the map changes? When both have changed? When both have changed and the change in the map was justified by the change in the territory?</p>]]></summary>

Certainly fiction-as-ideological vessel carries dangers.

<blockquote>
<p>GDP and derived metrics (e.g., productivity) have been central to understanding economic progress and well-being. In principle, the change in consumer surplus (compensating expenditure) provides a superior, and more direct, measure of the change in well-being, especially for digital goods, but in practice, it has been difficult to measure. We explore the potential of massive online choice experiments to measure consumers’ willingness to accept compensation for losing access to various digital goods and thereby estimate the consumer surplus generated from these goods. We test the robustness of the approach and benchmark it against established methods, including incentive compatible choice experiments that require participants to give up Facebook for a certain period in exchange for compensation. The proposed choice experiments show convergent validity and are massively scalable. Our results indicate that <strong>digital goods have created large gains in well-being that are missed by conventional measures of GDP and productivity</strong>. By periodically querying a large, representative sample of goods and services, including those which are not priced in existing markets, changes in consumer surplus and other new measures of well-being derived from these online choice experiments have the potential for providing cost-effective supplements to existing national income and product accounts.</p>

    <title>In praise of principal-agent problems</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-concept">The concept</h1>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal–agent problems</a> occur when a principal enlists an agent to act on their behalf, but the agent has private information and independent interests. This scenario means that the principal incurs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost">agency costs</a> when compared to simply acting themselves.</p>
<p>Examples include brokers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running">front running</a>, doctors <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-who-take-company-cash-tend-to-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs">prescribing medications based on their relationships with pharmaceutical companies</a>, and <a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/taxi-meter3.htm">taxis taking overlong routes</a>.</p>
<h1 id="principal-agent-possibilities">Principal-agent possibilities</h1>
<p>As these examples suggest, principal–agent problems are (I think) usually viewed as a bad thing. And they often are. But they can also be a refuge. To see this, we just have to flip our sympathies. The common examples encourage us to sympathize with the principal and see the agent as abusing their power.</p>
<p>Examples from the flipped perspective include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Micromanager</dt>
<dd>If your manager at work is a petty tyrant, you surely appreciate and exploit whatever gaps in their knowledge you can find to work in ways you believe more effective or just to preserve your psychological health.
</dd>
<dt>Overbearing parents</dt>
<dd>Some parents seem to think of their children as agents in the project of aggrandizing themselves. Children in this situation may justly find that moving out–an increase in agency costs—represents a gift.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The common theme here is that the principals are people of power misusing it and their ignorances open up little pockets of possibility for the less powerful.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-like-a-state"><em>Seeing like a state</em></h2>
<p>We can put this perspective to more grandiose ends. For example, we can view the story of <span class="citation" data-cites="scott1998">(Scott <a href="#ref-scott1998">1998</a>)</span> as the story of high modernists trying to reduce agency costs. In weak, early states, elite principals had limited capacity to bend the populace (agents) to their will. There simply wasn’t enough information for elites to make any but the most basic demands. It’s hard to conscript or tax citizens when you don’t know their names or even how many there are. From this principal–agent perspective, the celebrated ‘metis’ (local knowledge) is precisely the information asymmetry that justifies granting agents (some) freedom of action.</p>
<p>In other words, metis means that elite principals should delegate to agents because they don’t know everything. Principals respond to this fact by either trying to limit metis (to reduce agency costs) and make the people legible or by ignoring metis—to sometimes disastrous effect.</p>
<h2 id="why-nations-fail"><em>Why nations fail</em></h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> talks about problems that arise in stratified societies due to <a href="http://www.econport.org/content/teaching/modules/NFG/Commit.html">commitment problems</a>. I think we can also think of principal–agent problems as constraining autocracies (and other stratified, non-inclusive societies). A society in which there were no information asymmetries between autocrat and citizens would be the most perfect totalitarianism. Fortunately, no autocrat has yet achieved this and so autocrats must rely on other agents. These agents are assigned tasks with some latitude because the autocrat doesn’t know exactly how a task should be performed and task performance is evaluated with some latitude because the autocrat can’t know precisely how a task was executed. These twin latitudes create room for subversion or otherwise allow independent human expression rather than providing the autocrat with a nation of perfect puppets.</p>
<p>Just like in <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>, we can use this structural feature of stratified societies to explain the benefits of inclusive institutions. Principal–agent relationships will always be limited and brittle because the principal can only specify finite requirements. The success we see in principal–agent relationships often relies on some good faith on the part of the agent. But autocracies should often expect the principal–agent relationship to be adversarial. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule">Under these conditions, contracts and explicit requirements are often woefully inadequate.</a> On the other hand, inclusive institutions give everybody an independent stake in success—thereby converting agents into fellow principals and providing robust incentive alignment.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll note that as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance">mass surveillance</a> improves, this advantage for inclusivity weakens. As mentioned previously, principal–agent problems only exist in the face of information asymmetries. To the extent that surveillance gives principals more information about agents and their actions, agency costs are reduced and autocracies become more effective. I’m certainly not the first to point out how mass surveillance can enable further domination, but I think this is a somewhat interesting angle on that observation.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2013">(Acemoglu and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2013">2013</a>)</span> (and surely elsewhere), Acemoglu and Robinson contend that inclusive societies have inherent economic advantages over stratified societies. If true, this is quite important; it suggests that, in the long run, we should <span class="noted">expect inclusive societies to “win” out</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The moral arc of the universe bends toward justice and all that.</p>
<h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>
<p>But is it true? As far as I can tell, the best articulation of this claim is in section 6 of <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>. It lays out several claims in support of the argument that oligarchic societies have a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. In this post, we’ll focus on the first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a situation in which an individual or a group holds unconstrained political power. Also suppose that productive investments can be undertaken by a group of citizens or producers that are distinct from the “political elites”, i.e., the current power holders. The producers will only undertake the productive investments if they expect to receive the benefits from their investments. Therefore, a set of economic institutions protecting their property rights are necessary for investment. Can the society opt for a set of economic institutions ensuring such secure property rights? The answer is often no (even assuming that “society” wants to do so).</p>
<p>The problem is that the political elites—those in control of political power—cannot commit to respect the property rights of the producers once the investment are undertaken. Naturally, ex ante, before investments are undertaken, they would like to promise secure property rights. But the fact that the monopoly of political power in their hands implies that they cannot commit to not hold-up producers once the investments are sunk.</p>
<p>[…] The consequence is clear: without such protection, productive investments are not undertaken, and opportunities for economic growth go unexploited.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="counterclaim">Counterclaim</h1>
<p>Contrary to the claim here, I think a rational and informed autocrat could credibly support economic institutions like property rights. If the autocrat and the producers interact over a non-trivial period of time, producers can condition their behavior on the autocrat’s. That is, the producers can decide that they’ll only invest if the autocrat preserves economic freedoms. If the autocrat expropriates and otherwise abuses the producers, they’ll do the bare minimum (shirk). Knowing this, the autocrat realizes that they can’t simply choose to loot while the producers continue to invest. The autocrat’s choice is between looting a minimal economy and a more restrained taxation of a growing economy. Under the right circumstances, a rational autocrat would do best to choose taxing a growing economy rather than looting a minimal economy.</p>
<h1 id="model">Model</h1>
<h2 id="single-shot">Single-shot</h2>
<p>Let’s model this situation more explicitly to make our claims precise. We can describe it as a two player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game</a>. Player one is the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> and player two is the <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. During the game, the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> must decide to either <span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\)</span> at a sustainable rate or <span class="math inline">\(\text{Loot}\)</span> by taxing at an onerous rate, expropriating and otherwise taking a larger share of the economic output. We represent these actions as fractions of economic output taken by the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(1 \geq l &gt; k \geq 0\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> must decide to <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Shirk}\)</span>—just get by with a minimum amount of work at a subsistence standard of living—or <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Invest}\)</span>—devote more effort to production in the hopes of future improvements to productivity. The extra cost that producers pay when <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investing}\)</span> is represented by <span class="math inline">\(c &gt; 0\)</span>. In either case, <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> receive whatever fraction of the economic output the dictator doesn’t take—<span class="math inline">\(1 - k\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1 - l\)</span>. This is all described more succinctly in the table below:</p>
<figure>

<p>In this game, Acemoglu’s and Robinson’s claim is correct. <span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\backslash\mathtt{Invest}\)</span> is not an equilibrium. The <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> can always improve their outcome by switching from a strategy of <span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\text{Loot}\)</span>. Similarly, without any opportunity to recoup the increased cost of <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investing}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> will always prefer <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Shirking}\)</span>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="iterated">Iterated</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>But this isn’t a good model of the situation. <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrats}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> interact repeatedly over a sustained period of time. We have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game">repeated game</a>. Because no one knows when an autocrats reign will end, we avoid a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game#Finitely_repeated_games">finitely repeated game</a> and model this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game#Infinitely_repeated_games">infinitely repeated game</a> with a discount rate <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> or, less pessimistically, as a game with some fixed probability of continuing after each stage <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now that the game has a sequence of stages, we can meaningfully incorporate the impact of <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investing}\)</span>. The basic intuition is that there is some growth rate <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\delta} &gt; r \geq 1\)</span></span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> and each instance of <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investment}\)</span> compounds it. More formally, the productivity produced by actions up through time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p(\mathbf{a^t}) = r^{\sum_{t=0}^t \mathtt{I}(a_{\mathtt{R}}^t)}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is an indicator function defined as <img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/8714069561825009905.svg" title="
\mathtt{I}(a_{\mathtt{R}}^t) = \begin{cases}
  1 &amp; a_{\mathtt{R}}^t = \mathtt{Invest} \\
  0 &amp; a_{\mathtt{R}}^t = \mathtt{Shirk} \\
\end{cases}

<p>We just use this productivity multiplicatively with our previous terms so the new stage game looks like:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Contra <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>, autocrats can credibly cooperate in support of economic institutions which promote growth. The possibility for cooperation arises when we move from a single-shot game to a repeated game (as is often the case). This is bad news because it means we have one fewer reason to suppose that economics supports inclusivity in the long run.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="life-extension-in-autocrats">Life extension in autocrats</h1>
<p>In a <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bryan-caplan-case-for-and-against-education/">recent episode of the 80,000 hours podcast</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html">Bryan Caplan</a> briefly talked about totalitarianism. During that section of the conversation, he dropped this tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
[F]un fact is Stalin actually had a life-extension program dedicated to try to make himself immortal. It didn’t work, but my view that is if it worked, than I think the Soviet Union would still be ruled by Joseph Stalin.
</blockquote>
<h1 id="incentive-alignment">Incentive alignment</h1>
<p>Infinite tyrants sound worse than finite tyrants. But there’s a silver lining: Long tenure in autocrats discourages rapacity.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>For the theoretical argument, we turn to <span class="citation" data-cites="olson1993">(Olson <a href="#ref-olson1993">1993</a>)</span>. First, we suppose an autocrat is a rational, economically informed actor trying to maximize their total consumption over their lifetime. Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that an economy will generate its maximum income only if there is a high rate of investment and that much of the return on long-term investments is received long after the investment is made. This means that an autocrat who is taking a long view will try to convince his subjects that their assets will be permanently protected not only from theft by others but also from expropriation by the autocrat himself. If his subjects fear expropriation, they will invest less, and in the long run his tax collections will be reduced.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Now suppose that an autocrat is only concerned about getting through the next year. He will then gain by expropriating any convenient capital asset whose tax yield over the year is less than its total value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond limiting expropriation, an immortal autocrat would want to support other economic freedoms that increase long-run growth—as long as they encourage growth more than they imperil the autocrat. Other things in this category might include: the impartial enforcement of contracts and a stable currency.</p>
<p>Recapitulating, an autocrat that orients toward the long run gets to consume more in the long run—as long as they stay in power. All else equal, an immortal autocrat will stay in power longer than a merely mortal autocrat and thus has more incentive to focus on the long run. The good news is that everyone else also gets to consume more and enjoy more economic freedoms along the way.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="empirical-evidence">Empirical evidence</h2>
<p>If this model actually described reality, what might we observe? One thing we’d expect to see is that precarious autocrats expropriate more (to the extent they recognize their own precarity). And, indeed, we do see this.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="azzimonti2018">(Azzimonti <a href="#ref-azzimonti2018">2018</a>)</span> uses panel data on 145 countries from 1984–2014 and (among other things) looks at <span class="noted">government stability</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as determined by a panel of experts and risk of expropriation as determined by a panel of experts. It finds “a strong negative correlation between government stability and the risk of expropriation across regions. This indicates that countries where political turnover is high are more likely to engage in expropriation activities.”</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/moral-limits-markets-summary/">Last time</a>, I summarized Michael Sandel’s <em>What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="sandel2012">(Sandel <a href="#ref-sandel2012">2012</a>)</span>. Now, I’ll say my own things instead of regurgitating Sandel (as delicious as premasticated Sandel may be).</p>
<p>Throughout, I’ll try to resist temptation and keep the discussion to the <em>moral</em> failings of markets. There’s a whole vast literature on how and when markets fail on their own terms (i.e. don’t achieve social efficiency) that I’d like to avoid.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve tried to order things for comprehensibility, but there isn’t a single, coherent thesis here. Most of the sections are standalone.</p>
<h1 id="markets-defined">Markets defined</h1>
<p>I think it behooves us to start with a discussion of precisely what markets are. This should clarify and it should help us understand which features of markets are necessary and which contingent.</p>
<p>Without thinking <em>too</em> deeply about it, I’ll say a market is a legal and sociocultural system via which unaffiliated parties may exchange rights—paradigmatically, one party gives up the rights for exclusive use (i.e. property rights) of some tangible good and receives in exchange the rights for exclusive use of some quantity of money. I choose this annoyingly abstract definition to highlight the flexibility and generality of markets which is important when talking about atypical markets.</p>
<h1 id="markets-vs.property">Markets vs. property</h1>
<p>This definition quickly suggests the importance of distinguishing between markets (the mechanism of exchange) and property (what’s exchanged on the market). Property (or some other bundle of rights) is a precondition to markets. Unfortunately, I think the book rather wholly <span class="noted">elides this distinction</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Many of the ills attributed to atypical markets are more accurately pinned on property. In fact, I can’t think of any examples where ‘propertizing’ (i.e. formalizing and legislating the rights to some formerly fuzzy thing) is okay and market exchange is <span class="noted">squicky</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. If the market in slaves had been abolished and ownership of slaves could be transferred only by inheritance, chattel slavery would have been no less appalling.</p>
<p>This isn’t pure, idle pedantry. By omitting markets from the story, we highlight that core to the corruption concern is people relinquishing capacities we’d rather they keep. From this perspective, the problem with women agreeing to be sterilized for cash is that they’re relinquishing their reproductive rights while we think they ought to be inalienable; it invites outsiders in to our bodies. “Bank One blast” rankles because our choice of words ought to be our own; to do otherwise is to invite outsiders in to our minds.</p>
<p>We’re then left with the question: Is it best to deny people the capacity to relinquish certain capacities? Morally? Politically?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="inequality-vs.markets">Inequality vs. markets</h1>
<p>Another distinction which gets less attention than I’d like is between markets themselves and markets under conditions of inequality.</p>
<p>The glib (and yet obligatory) response here is to point to the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics: “out of all possible Pareto optimal outcomes, one can achieve any particular one by enacting a lump-sum wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over.” In other words, this just confirms that markets would achieve fairer outcomes under fairer circumstances.</p>
<p>But I don’t have a wand I can wave to eliminate inequality and I don’t expect to come across one any time soon. So I’ll try to engage with the argument more seriously.</p>
<p>Here’s my best counterargument to markets and inequality then. I think we can tell a story (by which I mean this is very speculative) where the growing reach of markets is a consequence rather than a cause of inequality. In this story, <span class="noted">powerful actors encourage the marketization of all things</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> because they expect to be able to better leverage their power on the market. When there’s a market in organs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">Mr. Burns</a> can buy all the spare organs he needs, no muss, no fuss. Without a market, he’d have to pursue a less savory route. If we believe this story, the retrenchment of markets might only lead the powerful to find some other mechanism to exercise their power.</p>
<p>All that said, I do more or less grant this argument. We live in a world of radical inequality and, in many circumstances, markets magnify that inequality.</p>
<h1 id="crowding-out-and-expressive-actions">Crowding out and expressive actions</h1>
<p>On multiple occasions, Sandel talks about market norms crowding out other norms. If we examine why this happens, I think we’ll find something useful.</p>
<p>Once we leave the most naive versions of rational choice, we can suggest that humans sometimes act for expressive reasons. That is, we intend to or happen to communicate with our actions. When I show up late to pick up my child, I express that I don’t value the time of the day-care workers. Conversely, punctuality expresses that I do. When I agree to accept nuclear waste in my town, I am communicating that I value my fellow citizens and that I am sensitive to claims of civic need.</p>
<p>On this view, market norms can crowd out other norms because they make it harder to express what people hope to express. Prompt pick up might express respect or it might express unwillingness to pay. Agreeing to house nuclear waste might express civic responsibility or it might just be a cash grab. If people are going to misinterpret an action, it’s a much less appealing expression.</p>
<p>If we accept this story, crowding out isn’t unique to the introduction of market incentives. <em>Any</em> additional incentives muddy the expressive waters. Because observers only see the action and not the intention, they’re left to guess which predominated.</p>
<h1 id="preferences-are-malleable">Preferences are malleable</h1>
<p>Markets as ‘corrupting’ is largely contingent. It depends on the meaning we assign to markets which is socioculturally determined. We can imagine some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Randian</a> paradise in which markets are held in the highest esteem. Here, allocating a thing via the market elevates rather than degrades.</p>
<p>Even short of some mass reeducation program that shifts the whole culture, I think this is relevant. I and many economists object to the use of markets much less than average, it seems. This suggests that at least some individuals can independently make peace with atypical markets. If the meaning assigned to markets changed enough for enough people, markets might be both more efficient and non-corrupting.</p>
<p>However, because markets are fundamentally an impersonal mechanism for the allocation of goods, that meaning is unavoidable. Actions intended to be personal and particularistic ought not to be conducted via the market.</p>
<h1 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h1>
<p>Sandel acknowledges that we may sometimes make moral comprises—we may accept the corruption of some good in exchange for the efficiency markets provide. However, Sandel never provides any detailed criteria or even examples for how we should make this trade-off. I think this is because is doing so would require describing and committing to some concrete, normative theory. His reluctance to do so is both understandable (it would take him on quite a tangent) and a bit ironic given his criticism of amoral economists. I think Sandel’s reluctance to defend any particular trade-off reveals just how tricky the thing he’s advocating for (bringing moral discussion into economic decisions) is.</p>
<h1 id="straw-man">Straw man</h1>
<p>The critique about economists being ignorant of the commercialization effect and otherwise believing in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">Homo economicus</a></em> uncritically rings false to me. This is what behavioral economics is all about and many of the works Sandel cites in support of his claims (e.g. the study of crowding out effects with placement of nuclear waste) were produced by economists!</p>
<h1 id="altruism-as-a-limited-resource">Altruism as a limited resource</h1>
<p>Sandel also critiques economists for claiming that we should favor markets to conserve the limited supply of altruism. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing">moral licensing</a> fairly directly suggests this. But I guess you could justly regard this with some skepticism because it’s social psychology and, you know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">the replication crisis</a>…</p>
<h1 id="morality-and-modernity">Morality and modernity</h1>
<p>Even if prosocial sentiment isn’t a depletable resource, I think it’s very plausible that the prosocial impulses of humans aren’t well-adapted to the modern world.</p>
<p>In the ancestral environment, anyone you interacted with was likely someone you knew fairly well. You were almost assured of interacting with them again. We could go on, but suffice it to say that modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_society">mass society</a> is nothing like this.</p>
<p><span class="noted">If our moral impulses are to give due consideration to those we know or those with whom we’ll interact again</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, they suffice for the ancestral environment and are woefully inadequate now. I feel a fondness for my family that militates against profit maximizing when letting them borrow my car but have no such compunction when renting my car out to the man who lives on the other side of city. In our impersonal era, we need social technology to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is an empirical question. I think it’s clear that people do give special moral consideration to those that are close to them. The question that’s left is if the lesser moral consideration allotted to strangers is sufficient to enable modern society without social technologies like markets. If not, do we sacrifice modernity (mass society) in the name of morality?</p>

Economic institutions determine the incentives of and the constraints on economic actors, and shape economic outcomes. As such, they are social decisions, chosen for their consequences. Because different groups and individuals typically benefit from different economic institutions, there is generally a conflict over these social choices, ultimately resolved in favor of groups with greater political power.

<h1 id="scope-of-markets">Scope of markets</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative">There is no alternative</a>. Markets are inescapable. But markets now extend beyond the mere exchange of commercial products into “spheres of life once governed by nonmarket norms”.</p>
<p>The book offers many, many (many) examples of this including:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
[I]n 2001, [a] British novelist […] wrote a book commissioned by Bulgari […]. [The author] agreed to mention Bulgari jewelry in the novel at least a dozen times. The book, aptly titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulgari_Connection">The Bulgari Connection</a> […] more than exceeded the required number of product references, mentioning Bulgari thirty-four times. [One critic] pointed to the clunkiness of the product-laden prose as in sentences such as this: “‘A Bulgari necklace in the hand is worth two in the bush,’ said Doris.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[T]he Campbell Soup Company sent out a free science kit that purported to teach the scientific method. With the use of a slotted spoon (included in the kit), students were shown how to prove that Campbell’s Prego spaghetti sauce was thicker than Ragú, the rival brand. General Mills sent teachers a science curriculum on volcanoes called “Gushers: Wonders of the Earth.” The kit included free samples of its Fruit Gushers candy, with soft centers that “gushed” when bitten. The teacher’s guide suggested that students bite into the Gushers and compare the effect to a geothermal eruption.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
When a bank bought the right to name the Arizona Diamondbacks’ stadium Bank One Ballpark, the deal also required that the team’s broadcasters call each Arizona home run a “Bank One blast.” […] Even sliding into home is now a corporate-sponsored event. [… F]or example, when the umpire calls a runner safe at home plate, a corporate logo appears on the television screen, and the play-by-play announcer must say, “Safe at home. Safe and secure. New York Life.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[The] North Carolina-based charity called Project Prevention, has a market-based solution: offer drug-addicted women $300 cash if they will undergo sterilization or long-term birth control. More than three thousand women have taken [up] the offer since […] 1997.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
Becker even proposed charging admission to refugees fleeing persecution. The free market, he claimed, would make it easy to decide which refugees to accept—those sufficiently motivated to pay the price: “For obvious reasons, political refugees and those persecuted in their own countries would be willing to pay a sizeable fee to gain admission to a free nation. So a fee system would automatically avoid time-consuming hearings about whether they are really in physical danger if they were forced to return home.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[There was another] use of life insurance that arose in the 1980s and 1990s, prompted by the AIDS epidemic. It was called the viatical industry. It consisted of a market in the life insurance policies of people with AIDS and others who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. Here is how it worked: Suppose someone with a $100,000 life insurance policy is told by his doctor that he has only a year to live. And suppose he needs money now for medical care, or perhaps simply to live well in the short time he has remaining. An investor offers to buy the policy from the ailing person at a discount, say, $50,000, and takes over payment of the annual premiums. When the original policyholder dies, the investor collects the $100,000.

<h1 id="the-morality-of-markets">The morality of markets</h1>
<p>This expansion of markets isn’t morally neutral.</p>
<h2 id="for-markets">For markets</h2>
<p>In favor of markets, Sandel lists two moral arguments.</p>
<p>The first is the libertarian, deontological argument about autonomy and liberty. This line of argument suggests that choice and freedom are the default and any abrogation of them must be thoroughly justified (or, for hardliners, is unjustifiable). The argument concludes by suggesting that markets are the natural result of these freedoms. If a market is merely what arises when individuals buy and sell their property, we should expect markets in anything and everything that individuals wish to buy or sell. To stop consenting adults from making such mutually beneficial transactions would be to unjustifiably tyrannize them.</p>
<p>The second argument is the utilitarian one. It emphasizes the ‘mutually beneficial’ part of the transaction. Markets allow trades and, in theory, trades only occur when both parties benefit. If we forbid these trades, we are, in effect, forbidding people from increasing their welfare. If we generalize this from a trade between two people to society as a whole, we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics">the first welfare theorem of economics</a>: Under certain technical conditions, a market equilibrium means that no one can be made better off without making someone worse off. That is, markets allocate goods to those most willing to pay for them.</p>
<h2 id="against-markets">Against markets</h2>
<p>On the ‘against’ side, Sandel again has two arguments.</p>
<p>The first is that markets are not fair. “The fairness objection points to the injustice that can arise when people buy and sell things under conditions of inequality or dire economic necessity. According to this objection, market exchanges are not always as voluntary as market enthusiasts suggest. A peasant may agree to sell his kidney or cornea to feed his starving family, but his agreement may not really be voluntary. He may be unfairly coerced, in effect, by the necessities of his situation.” Sandel goes on to highlight that markets don’t necessarily determine who values any given good most; they only determine who is most willing to pay. Willingness to pay is, in turn, the product of both interest and, crucially, <em>ability to pay</em>.</p>
<p>The second is about corruption. According to this objection, “Certain goods have value in ways that go beyond the utility they give individual buyers and sellers. How a good is allocated may be part of what makes it the kind of good it is.” To allocate a good via markets may, in some cases, degrade it by tainting it with a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred%E2%80%93profane_dichotomy">profane</a> set of norms.</p>
<p>“Tell me more about this corruption”, you, dear reader, conveniently say. “Okay”, I gamely reply.</p>
<p>One way in which markets can be corrupting is that they function like bribes. Sandel gives the example of health insurance discounts for healthy living. They “bypass persuasion and substitute an external reason for an intrinsic one”. I think he then <em>very</em> obliquely suggests that this has first-order ethical consequences because it discourages <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">the cultivation of virtue</a>. Sandel raises similar concerns about the disfiguring of civic and public virtues. It “dishonors their public spirit”.</p>
<p>Another crucial piece of the corruption story is that market incentives are <span class="noted">not merely additive</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Offering money in exchange for some good or task can crowd out and diminish other incentives. As evidence of this, he describes the famous (in certain circles) Israeli day-care study where parents picked up their children <em>later</em> after the introduction of a fine for late pickups <span class="citation" data-cites="gneezy2000">(Gneezy and Rustichini <a href="#ref-gneezy2000">2000</a>)</span>. He also describes a Swiss village where inhabitants were <em>less</em> willing to house nuclear waste if offered annual cash compensation than if done purely out of a sense of civic duty <span class="citation" data-cites="frey1997">(Frey and Oberholzer-Gee <a href="#ref-frey1997">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h2>
<p>We’ll close this section by noting that Sandel does acknowledge that corruption and unfairness aren’t definitive arguments against markets; they’re defeasible. “I do not claim that promoting virtuous attitudes toward the environment, or parenting, or education must always trump competing considerations. Bribery sometimes works. And it may, on occasion, be the right thing to do. […] But it is important to remember that it is bribery we are engaged in, a morally compromised practice that substitutes a lower norm […] for a higher one […].”</p>
<h1 id="economists-what-do-they-know-do-they-know-things-lets-find-out">Economists: What do they know? Do they know things?? Let’s find out!</h1>
<p>I’ll claim that a second major thread of the book is a sort of ethnography of economists.</p>
<p>Parallel to the expansion of markets is the growth of economists’ ambitions. Nowadays, economics is “not merely a set of insights about the production and consumption of material goods but also a science of human behavior.” (See <span class="citation" data-cites="fourcade2015">(Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan <a href="#ref-fourcade2015">2015</a>)</span> for another take on the ambition and position of economists.)</p>
<p>This creeping ambition makes the ‘amorality’ of economists especially troublesome, according to Sandel. “Most economists prefer not to deal with moral questions. […] The price system allocates goods according to people’s preferences; it doesn’t assess those preferences as worthy or admirable or appropriate to the circumstance.” But as markets shift from the allocation of widgets to the allocation of organs, political rights, humans, moral reasoning becomes much more salient.</p>
<p>Combined with this moral abstentionism, economists are (Sandel claims) characterized by a couple peculiar semi-empirical beliefs.</p>
<p>The first strange belief economists have is a willful (?) ignorance of the “commercialization” effect. This is basically just a claim that economists incorrectly disagree that market mechanisms can corrupt the goods they allocate.</p>
<p>The second wrongheaded belief of economists is that prosociality is a limited resource. To describe this belief, he cites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a>: “Like many economists, I do not want to rely too heavily on substituting ethics for self-interest. I think it best on the whole that the requirement of ethical behavior be confined to those circumstances where the price system breaks down […] We do not wish to use up recklessly the scarce resources of altruistic motivation.” Sandel grants that this belief would go a long way toward justifying a multitude of markets, but seems to reject the belief as strange and far-fetched. “It ignores the possibility that our capacity for love and benevolence is not depleted with use but enlarged with practice. Think of a loving couple. If, over a lifetime, they asked little of one another, in hopes of hoarding their love, how well would they fare?”</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="donor-lotteries">Donor lotteries</h1>
<p>Effective altruists have proposed and promoted <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14d/donor_lotteries_demonstration_and_faq/">donor lotteries</a>. Briefly, in a donor lottery, donors pool money for charitable contribution. They’re given lottery tickets in proportion to their contributions. The winner of the lottery gets to decide where the pool of charitable funds should be donated. For example, two people each set aside $1,000 for charitable contribution. They then make an agreement and the winner of the coin flip gets to donate the whole $2,000 to the charity of their choosing.</p>
<p>The primary claimed advantage to these lotteries is economies of scale. It probably doesn’t make sense to spend 100 hours picking the absolutely perfect charity when you’re only disbursing $1000 as a solo donor. It probably does make sense to spend the time to make the decision carefully when disbursing $100,000 as the winner of a donor lottery. Other economies of scale include things like: improved chance of response when asking charities for more information, can fund projects with threshold cost (i.e. we can’t even start the project unless we receive at least $XX,000 dollars).</p>
<h1 id="a-common-concern">A common concern</h1>
<p>Though the original proposals all highlight that the primary benefit of donor lotteries is economies of scale, I’ve heard many in the EA community concerned about alignment of other donors: “What if I don’t trust others in the lottery to do thorough research?” “What if others in the lottery prioritize different cause areas?”</p>
<p>Though early advocates address these concerns briefly, subsequent discussions suggests it might be useful to address these concerns more vividly.</p>
<h1 id="donor-lottery-with-the-devil">Donor lottery with the devil</h1>
<p>I contend you should be willing to enter a donor lottery with the devil (this is the weirdly honorable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil">Faustian</a> devil that respects all his compacts). To see this, we just proceed systematically.</p>
<p>Suppose you and the devil each contribute $10,000 dollars. This is your life savings while the devil merely tosses in a carbuncular carbuncle from his pit of gems and anguish. You flip a fair coin.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First, suppose you abstain: You spend your $10,000 dollars to do good, the devil spends his $X trillion to do evil, and the world hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Suppose you enter the lottery and win: You’ve doubled your money. Because we suppose economies of scale at relatively small amounts like this, the good you can do is more than doubled versus abstaining from the lottery and donating the initial $10,000. On the other side of the bet, the devil is forced to bankroll evil with a mere $X trillion - $10,000. Given the devil’s vast wealth, his plans are unconstrained by funding and the loss of $10,000 represents the evaporation of a single drop in an endless sea of agony. He goes on to do almost exactly as much evil as he would have done without the lottery.</p>
<p>Suppose you enter the lottery and lose: You’ve lost all your money and do no good whatsoever. The devil laughs in triumph, but his heart isn’t really in it. Because, again, the money means nothing to him. He’s working on higher levels in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a>.</p>
<p>Now we can calculate the expected value. The devil does just as much evil in each of the three outcomes. If you abstain from dealing with the devil, you do X good. If you enter the lottery, there’s a 50% chance you do &gt; 2X good and a 50% chance you do 0 good. The expected value of entering the lottery is then &gt; X.</p>
<h1 id="real-donor-lotteries">Real donor lotteries</h1>
<p>Obviously, this isn’t actually the decision that confronts you. But it highlights that the crucial consideration for donor lotteries is economies of scale. You should only worry about your fellow lottery participants insofar as you think they are significantly misaligned with you <em>and</em> have significantly <em>greater</em> economies of scale than you do. If either of these factors is small, you have little to worry about in this regard.</p>]]></summary>

A few weeks ago, I had an unusual — and challenging — assignment: providing a one-hour “tutorial” on the basic science of human-induced climate change to a Federal District Court in San Francisco. Judge William Alsup had requested this tutorial to bring him up to speed on the fundamental science before proceedings begin in earnest in a case brought by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, on behalf of the people of California, against a group of major fossil fuel companies, addressing the costs of climate change caused, they argue, by products those companies have sold.

<p>The paper’s a bit meandering, but I think the core idea—that a universal basic income and a job guarantee aren’t mutually exclusive or even particularly competitive—is valuable and true. The most import sources of conflict are probably finite supplies of political capital and the enormous complexity of implementing one of these policies, yet alone two.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Under simple majority rule, a largely indifferent majority can approve a result that is intensely opposed by everyone in the minority. If out-and-out bribery were permitted, it would be relatively easy for the minority to bribe the majority faction to defeat the hated policy, and, since the minority does really hate the original proposal, both they and the majority would be, on balance, better off in the post-bribe situation. The original result of majority rule was not Pareto optimal. It was economically inefficient.</p>
<p>In the real world, it is not necessary to buy votes, either of individual voters or their representatives. What we actually see as a part of normal democratic practice is a process of vote trading, sometimes called “logrolling.” Voter 1 cares deeply about issue A but not about issue B. It is then rational for voter 1 to trade his vote on B for voter 2’s vote on A. As a result, everyone is better off. Dennis Mueller, Geoffrey Philpotts, and Jaroslav Vanek demonstrated in a 1972 paper in Public Choice that the analogy between the efficiency of ordinary markets and the efficiency of vote trading in the political sphere is almost perfect.1 In nearly all cases, a system of logrolling will take a society to a state very close to Pareto optimality.Earmarks are merely a special case of logrolling. They enable political minorities (even a minority of one) to have an impact on policy, despite an apathetic or even hostile majority.</p>

<p>Interestingly, most of the reasons advanced here aren’t about social psychology being ‘worse’ than other fields (e.g. more corrupt, less competent) but ‘better’ (e.g. more open with data, replications are easier). The one explanation offered contrary to that pattern is “psychology studies often (not always, but often) feature weak theory + weak measurement”.</p></li>

They have driven us away from our houses and gardens to work as prisoners in their factories and their seminaries of vice. <span class="attribution">Thomas Exell, 1838</span>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/">Last time</a>, we reviewed the putting out system—a pre-industrial system of manufacture used in England where workers would take intermediate products home, refine them in some way, and return them to a merchant so that some other worker could perform the next step in the production process. Then, I suggested that this system sounds a lot like the modern gig economy.</p>
<p>Which left us with the question: Why is the gig economy worse than regular, full-time employment (for workers), but putting-out was better than factories (for workers)? We can resolve this tension by either finding that contemporary praise of the putting out system is wrong, finding that criticism of the gig economy is wrong, or (hint, hint) highlighting the disanalogies between the systems.</p>
<h1 id="was-putting-out-actually-preferred-to-factories">Was putting-out actually preferred to factories?</h1>
<h2 id="direct-evidence">Direct evidence</h2>
<p>Obviously, we can’t answer this question definitively and our <span class="noted">direct evidence</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> is weak. One piece of direct evidence we do have is contemporary complaints about the factory system like that in the epigraph. Of course, these are only anecdotes and it’s hard to generalize or be sure they’re representative, but, try as I might, I couldn’t find any anecdotes on the other side of the issue—there were no early factory workers singing praises of child labor and 14 hour days.</p>
<p>Another piece of information which tends to reveal preferences is: “[W]here alternatives to factory employment were available, there is evidence that workers flocked to them. […] [D]espite the abysmally low level to which wages fell [in the non-factory cotton weaving industry], a force of domestic cotton weavers numbering some 250,000 survived well into the nineteenth century.” <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> It is, of course, impossible to be certain that worker aversion to factories is what drove this behavior.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>One last claim from this angle: It seems widely acknowledged that workers struggled to transition to the factory model. Factory work was perhaps never fully accepted by adults forced to transition to it and was only accepted by children who had grown up working in factories or expecting to work in factories (a la “Science advances one funeral at a time.”). “The early industrial capitalists spent a great deal of effort and time in the social conditioning of their labor force” <span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2001">(Mokyr <a href="#ref-mokyr2001">2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="indirect-evidence">Indirect evidence</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/#transition">Last time, we covered some of the reasons that factory work might have been unappealing.</a></p>
<p>I trust that the reader can call to mind or find lots more about the abysmal conditions of early factories.</p>
<h2 id="an-objection">An objection</h2>
<p>One objection the attentive reader might raise is: If the workers didn’t like factories, why did they transition to them? Standard economic logic dictates that actors don’t make self-defeating choices so they must have actually preferred factories. The story here is that the productivity of factories was so great and decreased prices so much that the comparatively inefficient putting-out system was no longer sustainable. Factory driven changes in market conditions meant workers were faced with the choice of penury or factory work. <span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2001">(Mokyr <a href="#ref-mokyr2001">2001</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="summation">Summation</h2>
<p>I’ll readily admit that no particular piece of evidence here is impressive. In the aggregate though, I’m still fairly ready to believe that workers preferred the putting-out system to factory work.</p>
<h1 id="is-flsa-work-actually-preferred-to-gig-work">Is FLSA work actually preferred to gig work?</h1>
<p>(FLSA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> and we’ll use work where these rules apply as a conceptual shorthand for ‘normal’ work.)</p>
<p>Sadly, the intervening centuries don’t mean that we’re drowning in evidence on these questions. Everyone in the nascent gig economy literature seems to lament that the best source of data is a 2005 (!) BLS report on <em>Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangements</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="bls2005">(Labor Statistics (BLS). <a href="#ref-bls2005">2004</a>)</span>. Obviously, there wasn’t much of a gig economy in 2005 so data from that report is best interpreted with caution.</p>
<h2 id="direct-evidence-1">Direct evidence</h2>
<p>Caveats aside, here’s a key finding: By their narrowest definition of contingent worker (wage and salary workers who indicate that they expect to work in their current job for 1 year or less and who have worked for their current employer for 1 year or less) 63% of workers in these contingent and alternative arrangements would have preferred a job that was permanent. A somewhat broader definition of contingent worker (includes the self-employed) drops that to 57%.</p>
<p>Another story you can tell as to worker attitudes on contingent work: “When workers were in a strong bargaining position from 1995 to 2001, the share of contingent workers fell. Gig jobs declined as a share of the economy when workers had more bargaining leverage during the employment boom—the first internet boom—of the second Clinton Administration. This suggests that it is employers, not employees, who are pushing the gig economy.” <span class="citation" data-cites="friedman2014">(Friedman <a href="#ref-friedman2014">2014</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="indirect-evidence-1">Indirect evidence</h2>
<p>There are, of course, many disadvantages to gig work which might cause workers to dislike it. For one, gig workers tend to earn less than traditional employees after controlling for education <span class="citation" data-cites="friedman2014">(Friedman <a href="#ref-friedman2014">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There’s also a whole bundle of benefits mandated by the FLSA in the U.S. Gig workers are not guaranteed these things. The benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimum wage</li>
<li>overtime compensation</li>
<li>unemployment compensation</li>
<li>family and medical leave</li>
<li>employer payroll taxes</li>
<li>collective bargaining rights</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, a majority of workers in FLSA positions are offered the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>health insurance</li>
<li>retirement</li>
<li>life insurance</li>
<li>paid sick leave</li>
<li>paid vacations</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the arguments in favor of gig work are very similar to those advanced in favor of putting-out in the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/#transition">previous post in the series</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summation-1">Summation</h2>
<p>Ultimately, though I’m far from certain, I find the evidence above somewhat persuasive. It seems likely to me that most workers in the gig economy would prefer other arrangements.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It’s hard to be certain, but it seems that both claims might be true. Putting-out was better than factories for workers and gig work is worse than FLSA employment for most workers. That means our only way out is to discern the crucial differences between now and then. Next time.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Ethics is fundamentally about ‘ought’. What ought we to do? Which actions are proscribed and which prescribed? Among all available actions, which should we actually pursue? I think we can formalize this basic understanding and draw some interesting conclusions.</p>
<p>For any given ethical decision, we have some nonempty set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> (depending on how we individuate, possibly infinite) of possible actions. But, alas, we cannot perform all these actions; only one. So an ethical theory is something that for every possible <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> selects a distinguished element <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>. That is, an ethical theory is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function">choice function</a> over nonempty sets of actions.</p>
<p>In the rest of the post, we’ll discuss what properties such an ethical choice function might have and build up an understanding of how the tools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order theory</a> might be applied to metaethical reasoning.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="one-elementaction">One element/action</h1>
<p>Let’s try to think about this ethical choice function in a little more detail. We’ll start with the simplest case:</p>
<div class="single-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>sets with only a single element. Here, our choice function simply plucks out this single element. In symbols, <span class="math inline">\(\forall a \in \mathcal{A} : f(\{a\}) = a\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ethics-col">
<p>ethical choices with only one possible action (i.e. there is not even a choice between action and inaction). Here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can">we’d hope our ethical theory would recommend the only possible action</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 id="two-elementsactions">Two elements/actions</h1>
<p>On to the next step:</p>
<div class="double-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>Now, we want to define our choice function over two element sets as well. In order to relate the two elements in each set, we must talk about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">binary relation</a> that we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span> (read <span class="math inline">\(a \prec b\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is worse than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> or as <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is better than <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>).

If we stick to our earlier claim that an ethical theory must pick a distinguished element “for every possible” <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> (which, tendentiously, we will for the rest of the post), then we’re also requesting <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_relation">totality</a></span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. (Totality also demands an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence relation</a>. We choose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics)">identity relation</a> for the remaining discussion.)</p>
<p>So our choice function applies our irreflexive, asymmetric binary relation to our two element set and always chooses the better element of the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="ethics-col">
<p>What happens when our ethical theory needs to actually start pulling its weight and giving guidance between two different actions (call them A and B)? At its simplest, the theory can either declare that A is better or instead that B is better. Or it might declare that the two actions are incomparable—neither stands anywhere in ethical relation to the other. This is often unsatisfactory (as suggested in a <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-examples/">previous post</a>). So we’ll provisionally adhere to the introduction’s demand that our ethical theory never avail itself of this escape hatch. This demand for comprehensive guidance means that we also need a notion of moral equivalence. At a minimum, every action must be morally equivalent to itself. (Our ethical theory ought not to claim that action A is better than A.)</p>
<p>All of that is to say, when presented with two different actions, our ethical theory always recommends one or the other as the better to pursue.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the liberty of categorizing the rows. Those in category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span> rely on <span class="noted">transitivity</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> of our binary relation. Those in category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> rely on transitivity of the identity relation. In category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Y}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a ? c\)</span> is underdetermined, but each <span class="math inline">\(\prec b\)</span>. In category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a ? c\)</span> is again undefined but <span class="math inline">\(b \prec\)</span> each.</p>
<p>Transitivity of the identity relation strikes me as /very/ innocuous. Transitivity of the binary relation also seems very intuitive to me, but some contest it. See, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="rachels1998">(Rachels <a href="#ref-rachels1998">1998</a>)</span>. In category $, because our choice function only needs to select the one best element, we don’t care that <span class="math inline">\(a ? c\)</span> is undetermined—<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is greater than both. It’s only in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span>, that we must again resort to our binary relation to settle whether element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is greater. Putting that all together, we rewrite the table:</p>

<p>How does our ethical theory cope when asked to recommend among three distinct, ethically relevant actions (call them A, B, and C)?

<p>6 of the 8 (i.e. all but rows 2 and 7 in the table) are perfectly reasonable and take a form like ‘A is better than B which is better than C with is the worst.’. However, 2 of the 8 pairwise combinations (i.e. rows 2 and 7 in the table) produce cycles like ‘A is better than B which is better than C which is better than A which is better than B’ which continues ad nauseum.</p>
<p>Needless to say, permitting cycles in our ethical theory has many strange consequences. If we wish to forbid these cycles, the property we must appeal to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">transitivity</a>. Nevertheless, the transitivity of ‘better than’ is actually an open question in the philosophical community. See, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="rachels1998">(Rachels <a href="#ref-rachels1998">1998</a>)</span> for an entry point into that discussion.</p>
<p>Since my intuitions argue in favor of transitivity being important, we’ll assume that for the remainder of the post.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we’ve upgraded our ethical theory to work across sets of three actions by doing pairwise comparisons and aggregating them to find the best option subject to certain reasonableness constraints.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 id="and-beyond">And beyond</h1>
<p>This is quickly becoming tedious. Surely, we can’t hope to construct the choice function for each possible cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> on unto infinity. As it turns out we don’t need to. We now have all the tools we need to generalize.</p>
<div class="general-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>If we review all the properties we’ve accumulated on our binary relation, it is (somewhat redundantly) irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive, trichotomous, and total. That is, our binary relation is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order#Strict_total_order">strict total order</a>. And the choice function we’ve been implementing so far simply picks the greatest element in each subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. We can extend this indefinitely. A total order on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> with the property that every nonempty subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> has a greatest element is a (inverted) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order">well-order</a>. <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Finite_Totally_Ordered_Set_is_Well-Ordered">Every finite total order is also a well-order</a>. So we can generalize this approach to the choice function to arbitrary subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> of finite cardinality <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We leave the issue of infinite <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> aside for the moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="ethics-col">
<p>We can, in principle, follow this same basic approach to scale our ethical theory to choose among an arbitrary number of actions. We just keep making pairwise comparisons until we conclude what the best option is (We’re guaranteed a unique answer as long as the pairwise comparisons obey transitivity.).</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We started with the claimed insight that ethical theories are choice functions—for each moral decision, an ethical theory must pick a single distinguished action (that which we ought to perform) from the set of all available actions. From there, we built up a procedure for turning a ‘better than’ binary relation into a well-order. Once we have a well-order with its greatest element guarantee, a choice function is trivial. That is, if the problem of ethics is to find a choice function, an ethical well-order is a good candidate for that choice function.</p>
<p>Along the way, we made several choices about how our choice function and binary relation ought to behave. While these choices weren’t arbitrary, they were only sparsely defended. I plan to examine these assumptions and alternatives in more depth in future posts.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="von-neumannmorgenstern-utility-theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</a> says that, “under certain axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he or she is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future”. But the somewhat sloppy way I like to think of it is this: If a person has merely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility">ordinal preferences</a> (e.g. I prefer an apple to a banana but can’t or won’t quantify the magnitude of that preference. The preceding information alone isn’t enough to conclude how I’d feel about one apple vs. two bananas.) and reasons well under uncertainty, we can transform those ordinal preferences into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility function</a> (e.g. I like apples exactly twice as much as bananas and would be indifferent between an apple and two bananas (ignoring diminishing marginal utility for the same of exposition).).</p>
<p>This transformation is often useful because a cardinal utility function is much richer and more informative than an ordinal utility function. The extra information is useful, for example, in sidestepping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s impossibility theorem</a> (which says that it’s impossible to have a good voting system if you only ask people for their ordering of candidates).</p>
<h1 id="interactive-vnm">Interactive VNM</h1>
<p>The standard descriptions of the mechanism of the VNM utility theorem may be a little opaque. But because the theorem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof">constructive</a>, we can actually give people a feel for it by putting them ‘inside’ the mechanism and showing them the result. That’s what we attempt here.</p>
<p>In the first text area, enter a list of goods (each on a separate line) for which you’d like to generate a utility function. It starts with a few sample goods, but you’re free to add, remove or otherwise alter these.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided upon the goods you’re interested in, you can proceed to the next step. Here, you’ll be presented with a series of lotteries. In each lottery, you have to decide whether you prefer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> lottery tickets for one good over <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> lottery tickets for the other good, or if you’re indifferent. If your lottery ticket is drawn, you win whatever good is on the ticket. You can register your answer as to which set of tickets you prefer by clicking on one of the three blue boxes.</p>
<p>For example, if you mildly prefer bananas to carrots, you’d click on the banana box when presented with one lottery ticket for each. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot, by your lights (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>). On the other hand (because your preference was only mild), you’d click on the carrot box if offered 100 carrot tickets vs. 1 banana ticket. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 101\)</span>).</p>
<p>After you’ve repeated this process enough, we can deduce what your favorite good of all the listed goods is. With this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire">numéraire</a>, we can start to visualize your utility function and do so with a chart that appears at the bottom. But, of course, we still have uncertainty about the relative value of these goods. Based on the questions you answer, we know upper and lower bounds for your value (a carrot is better than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100}\)</span> banana but worse than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1}\)</span> banana). Over time, by answering more questions, we can refine these intervals until they’re arbitrarily small.</p>

<p>I can also imagine the basic setup of VNM as useful for preference elicitation. If you ask respondents in a survey to directly assign cardinal values to various outcomes, I suspect they will have little intuition for the task and generate poor estimates. Presenting them with a series of lotteries is at least a different task and it may turn out to be an easier or more accurate one.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Pareto improvement as partial order</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We covered the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto improvement</a> in the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-examples/">preceding post</a>. I briefly alluded to the fact that it’s a strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial order</a>. Let’s explore that a bit more.</p>
<h1 id="partial-order">Partial order</h1>
<p>A strict partial order is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">binary relation</a> that is irreflexive (no element precedes itself), and transitive. Pareto improvement satisfies both of these criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Irreflexive: <span class="math inline">\(\neg (A \prec A)\)</span></dt>
<dd>No scenario is a Pareto improvement over itself because no one strictly prefers it (person 1 doesn’t prefer scenario A to scenario A), trivially.
</dd>
<dt>Transitive: <span class="math inline">\(A \prec B, B \prec C \Rightarrow A \prec C\)</span></dt>
<dd>If arbitrary scenario B is a Pareto improvement over arbitrary scenario A and arbitrary scenario C is a Pareto improvement over scenario B, then scenario C is a Pareto improvement over scenario A. In other words, if no one is worse off in scenario B than scenario A and no one is worse off in scenario C than scenario B, then, clearly, no one is worse off in scenario three than scenario A. And if at least one person is better off in scenario B than scenario A and at least one person is better off in scenario C than scenario B, then, clearly, at least one person is better off in scenario C than scenario A.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Alternatively, we can just take the shortcut of noting that Pareto improvement is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_order">componentwise order</a> of the total orders of individual preferences.</p>
<h1 id="total-order">Total order</h1>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-examples/">preceding post</a>, we objected to the fact that Pareto improvement is partial—unable to render judgment between many scenarios and declare one as better than another despite our strongest intuitions. <span class="noted">We could remedy this problem if instead we had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. We turn a strict partial order into a strict total order by adding the following property:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Trichotomous: <span class="math inline">\((A \prec B) \lor (B \prec A) \lor (A = B)\)</span></dt>
<dd>Arbitrary scenario A is preferred to arbitrary scenario B or scenario B is preferred to scenario A or scenario A and B are the same.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The question is, how to introduce this property? If we’re able to introduce this property while retaining the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thick-ethical-concepts/">thinness</a> (i.e. value neutrality) of Pareto improvement, that would be a very interesting thing indeed. We would have a tool to judge any and every policy, any and every state of society, any and every counterfactual world while keeping our private values out of the decision. We would, perhaps, have “solved” objective morality.</p>
<p><!-- In fact, we could define an "index of totality" for a partially ordered set $P$ as $\frac{\text{no. of antichains in }P}{|P|}$ where $\frac{1}{|P|}$ means all elements in $P$ are incomparable to each other (e.g. $(0, 2)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(2, 0)$ when lifting $\lt$ via the componentwise order) and $\frac{|P|}{|P|}$ means all elements are comparable to each other (e.g. $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$). Thus, an index of totality at $1$ actually indicates a total order. With this notion in mind, instead of demanding a total order, we could instead try to fix the problems of Pareto improvement by demanding some partial order with a sufficiently high index of totality. All that said, we'll set this idea aside for the moment. --></p>

</blockquote>
<h1 id="putting-out-system">Putting-out system</h1>
<p>Between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild#Fall_of_the_guilds">guild system</a> and the full steam <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, England briefly used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putting-out_system">putting-out system</a>. Under this system, finished goods were assembled not in factories or dedicated workshops, but component-by-component in a multitude of homes and cottages.</p>
<p>For example (illustrative hypothetical based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing_by_pre-industrial_methods">Wikipedia</a>): One worker would trundle their hand cart to the market, drop off cleaned wool in exchange for a piece rate payment, and the merchant would dispatch them with a new load of wool. That merchant would take this cleaned wool and give it to another independent worker for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding">carding</a>. The carder would take the cleaned wool home, the family would process it in their home, and then return to the market in a couple weeks to give the merchant carded wool. This staged process would repeat with a separate family taking home loads of inputs and returning outputs for each subsequent stage in the process—spinning, plying, weaving, etc. When the final task was complete, the merchant would take the finished goods to a market or store and sell them to consumers. In this way, the task was broken down into small components and coordinated by the merchants—somewhat like a (spatially and temporally) disaggregated assembly line.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="transition">Transition</h2>
<p>But this system didn’t last forever. Early factories soon arose and by 1850, piece work was all but dead. <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> The factory had won out. To what effect?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2001">(Mokyr <a href="#ref-mokyr2001">2001</a>)</span> highlights a number of detriments unique to factory work:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Commuting</dt>
<dd>Walking to work (the only widely accessible form of transit then available) reduces time available for leisure and so reduces welfare in ways that don’t show up in the most obvious measures (e.g. GDP).
</dd>
<dt>Leisure-income choice</dt>
<dd>In the putting out system, households (this unjustly ignores intra-household decision-making) could choose how much time they wanted to devote to work in very fine-grained increments. With the factory system, work became “all or nothing”. For many, this reduced choice would have reduced welfare. I’ve often heard even modern coworkers wish for an option to work only, say, three days a week.
</dd>
<dt>Multitasking</dt>
<dd>The shift to factory work eliminated the opportunity for multitasking. The most important example of multitasking available in the putting-out system was looking after children while performing other work.
</dd>
<dt>Working environment</dt>
<dd>Early factories were nasty, brutish and liable to shorten the lives of their workers.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we listen to <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> tell it, factories were a disaster for workers and to the benefit of only the capitalists:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he origin and success of the factory lay not in technological superiority, but in the substitution of the capitalist’s for the worker’s control of the work process and the quantity of output, in the change in the workman’s choice from one of how much to work and produce […] to one of whether or not to work at all, which of course is hardly much of a choice.
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll take a moment to explicitly note this for the ensuing discussion: An avowed leftist publishing in the <em>Review of radical political economics</em> comes out strongly in favor of putting-out over factory work. I suspect many other leftists would have similar sympathies.</p>
<h1 id="the-gig-economy">The gig economy</h1>
<p>I hope the earlier description of the putting-out system echoed. To me, it sounds a great deal like a technologically limited gig economy. In both systems, workers have considerable freedom over how much work they perform, but not which tasks. Their tasks are assigned by a central clearinghouse which also mediates their relationship with the final consumer. Unlike freelancers, workers have relationships with only one or a few buyers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony">monopsony</a>/ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopsony">oligopsony</a>). Unlike modern full-time employees, in both systems, workers have very limited physical interactions with their employer.</p>
<p>If you accept the aptness of this analogy, we’re left with a confusion. Why was the putting-out system considered better than full-time, centralized employment while the gig economy is often considered worse? Especially from the leftist perspective?</p>
<div class="skippable">
<h2 id="gig-hate">Gig hate</h2>
<p>If you doubt that leftists look dimly on the gig economy, look no further:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/gig-economy-dpd-courier-taylor-review">The gig economy is being fuelled by exploitation, not innovation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/26/gig-economy-flexibility-exploitation-record-employment-low-wages-zero-hours">Some praise our gig economy flexibility. I call it exploitation</a></li>

<h1 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h1>
<p>We have three ways to reconcile the apparent conflict. People are wrong about the putting-out system, people are wrong about the gig economy, or the two systems are crucially different.

    <updated>2018-04-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of time reading. But I’m not actually reading very quickly. The typical educated adult reads at about 200 to 400 <abbr title="words per minute">wpm</abbr> (for context, a speaking rate of 150 to 160 <abbr title="words per minute">wpm</abbr> is comfortable). Given that, it seems <em>possible</em> that a better understanding of reading could help me spend that time better. So I read <span class="citation" data-cites="rayner2016">(Rayner et al. <a href="#ref-rayner2016">2016</a>)</span>. Spoiler: It didn’t transform the way I read (and reaffirmed that speed reading is rather less than advocates claim), but it was definitely interesting. The regurgitation that follows focuses more on the article’s description of the ‘how’ of reading and less on the debunking of speed reading.</p>
<p><a href="#summary" class="no-home">Summary</a></p>
<h1 id="speech-writing">Speech &gt; writing</h1>
<p>Speech is prior to writing. Spoken language is thought to have originated around 100,000 years ago; written language 5,000 years ago. All human societies have spoken language; not so for writing. No natural language is purely written. Children learn to speak and interpret language without explicit instruction; not so for reading. Thus, we reach the claim that reading and writing is an “optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on” <span class="citation" data-cites="mcguinness1997">(McGuinness <a href="#ref-mcguinness1997">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>After this bolting is complete, many of our reading processes are still mediated by our more fundamental spoken language processes—even during silent reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, when researches asked silent readers to rapidly decide whether words belonged to a category, homophones produced incorrect “yes”es 19% of the time (whether “meet” belongs in the category food) compared to the base rate for orthographically similar words of 3% (<span class="noted">whether “melt” belongs in the category food</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>). The implication here is that we have difficulty translating directly from visual input to units of meaning and this visual-meaning connection is often mediated by the auditory representation.</p></li>
<li><p>In a different study, researchers asked readers to repeat an irrelevant word or phrase aloud while reading in an effort to impede any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization">subvocalization</a>. These readers performed worse on a subsequent test of comprehension than those asked to repeat a sequence of finger taps.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So our brains aren’t great at reading. But neither are our eyes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="our-eyes-are-terrible-and-wonderful">Our eyes are terrible and wonderful</h1>
<h2 id="acuity">Acuity</h2>
<p>Our visual field is divided into three concentric circles. Most central is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis">fovea</a> which extends from the absolute center to the circle 1° of visual angle away from it; this is about the size of your thumb held at arm’s length. The next circle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parafovea">parafovea</a> which extends from 1° to 5° from the center of vision. The periphery encompasses anything beyond this.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/how-do-we-read/fovea.jpg" alt="Zones of the visual field" /><figcaption>Zones of the visual field</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a word is presented so briefly that readers have no time to move their eyes, accuracy is high when the word is centered in the fovea. But accuracy drops off rapidly till it’s no better than chance at around 3° from the center of vision.</p>
<p>Part of the story here is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell">cones</a> (the detail-oriented, bright light photoreceptors) are concentrated in the fovea while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell">rods</a> (sensitive primarily to brightness and motion in dim light) increase in concentration with distance from the fovea. Yet more interesting, inputs from rods are pooled before being relayed to the brain. That is, if half the rods in a group are fully lit and half are in total darkness, the brain will receive a signal indicating middling illumination. Cones, in contrast, would signal a light/dark boundary here because each has an unmediated connection to the brain.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
<p>Because our region of focus is so limited, readers must necessarily move the focus of their eyes along text via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccades</a> (short, ballistic movements of both eyes)</p>
<figure>
<embed src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/how-do-we-read/saccade.webm">
</embed>
<figcaption>
<p>Saccades</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each saccade lasts roughly 20 to 35 ms and spans (in English) about 7 letters.</p>
<p>“Return sweeps” (long saccades moving your eye to the beginning of the next line) are often imperfect but are quickly corrected with a follow-up saccade.</p>
<h2 id="fixation">Fixation</h2>
<p>Between saccades, the eyes are fairly stable. These stable periods are called fixations and last about 250 ms. However, studies have found that reading behavior and comprehension is unaffected when each word disappears 60ms after the beginning of fixation (that is, our eyes continue to stare at now blank space). The remaining portion of the 250ms appears to be devoted to some essential higher-level processing which most occur before we can proceed to the next word.</p>
<p>For many words, adult readers <span class="noted">recognize all the letters simultaneously</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. This is limited by visual acuity as we discussed above—the word identification span is only about 7 characters to the right of the fixation point. Thus, long words require at least a saccade and multiple fixations.</p>
<h1 id="from-squiggles-to-meaning">From squiggles to meaning</h1>
<p><span class="noted">Words are the basic unit of meaning in language</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. So they are the first step in building from raw visual input to real communication. In fact, studies indicate that word-identification ability is the best determinant of reading speed (though skilled readers also have shorter fixations, longer saccades and fewer <span class="noted">regressions</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>)</p>
<p>In turn, the best determinant of word-identification ability is <span class="noted">the frequency with which the reader has seen the word</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Common words like ‘house’ are more quickly recognized than uncommon words like ‘abode’. This word-frequency effect has been measured in lexical decision tasks (Is the string of characters a word or not?), naming tasks (Read a word aloud as quickly as possible), and categorization tasks (Does the given word belong in a semantic category?).</p>
<p>Some words (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph">homographs</a>) <span class="noted">can’t possibly be assigned a unique meaning without context. Sentence context helps disambiguate these words.</span><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> Interestingly, contexts that make the next word very predictable often lead to the word being skipped entirely (i.e. the saccade moves over the word entirely and it receives no fixation). This happens about 30% of the time.</p>
<p>(This all begins to sound very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian</a>.)</p>
<p>Readers slow down a bit at the end of sentences and phrases. So there is some yet higher-level processing that occurs even after words have been been translated into units of meaning.</p>
<h1 id="speed-reading">Speed reading</h1>
<p>Much of the technology (e.g. Spritz) and teaching around speed reading supposes that the problem is just about getting your eyes through the words as fast as possible. This isn’t accurate. The limiting factors for reading speed seem to be primarily cognitive.</p>
<p>Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) precludes regressing to previous words, but this is a normal and healthy part of reading. Preventing it impairs comprehension. Additionally, having a preview of words to come (impossible in the RSVP setup) in the parafovea somewhat increases reading speed. All you get in exchange for these losses is the omission of saccades. But saccades aren’t wasted time, relevant cognition can continue while the eyes are in transit.</p>
<p>Speed reading advocates often suggest eliminating subvocalization. As discussed earlier, this is extremely difficult given the primacy of spoken language and impairs comprehension.</p>
<p>They also often advocate for “taking in” larger chunks of text—whole lines, paragraphs or even pages of text at once. As the discussion of the visual acuity highlights this is impossible.</p>
<h1 id="reading-better">Reading better</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, more exposure to a word makes its subsequent recognition faster. Thus more reading will improve the all-important speed of word identification. More reading will also improve your predictions of upcoming words and improve your ability to synthesize and extrapolate from missing information (The authors suggest that this is part of what’s happening in speed readers. Intelligent people that spend a lot of time reading are good at filling in the gaps to compensate for their low comprehension at the purely linguistic level.)</p>
<p>The authors also highlight that skimming is sometimes appropriate and merited. When this is the case, skimmers should pay special attention to headings, paragraph structure and key words. Paying equal attention to all content is a poor use of limited time.</p>
<p>If you find the modesty of these suggestions discouraging, I quite understand. But, the authors conclude that, as in so many things, there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. There’s a fairly inescapable trade-off between speed and accuracy in reading.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Speech is more fundamental than writing. Reading is mediated by spoken language in surprising ways.</p>
<p>Our eyes have very limited acuity. As such, we must saccade from one word to the next. In between saccades, we fixate. In each fixation, a word is most often recognized as a gestalt unit. Our ability to recognize words depends on both local context (other words in the sentence) and a larger context (our history of reading and our knowledge of the world).</p>
<p>Speed reading doesn’t work.</p>
<p>The only credible suggestion for becoming a faster reader is: Read more.</p>

The world in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe_economy">Robinson Crusoe and Friday</a> share coconuts seems vastly better than the world in which Crusoe sits on his coconut throne and doles out the barest sustenance to Friday. It is easy to leap from this intuition to the conclusion that equality is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value">intrinsic</a> good. But, in this post, let’s make a stop at the proposition that equality is instead only an instrumental good.</p>
<h2 id="equality-instrumentally">Equality instrumentally</h2>
<p>If our sole intrinsic good is something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utils</a>, we will still often prefer equality to inequality. What sorcery could introduce such deontological concepts into our consequentialist paradise? The incantation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility">“diminishing marginal utility”</a>. It is an empirical proposition (and mostly fact) that humans do not enjoy their 10th print copy of even their favorite book as much as the first. Thus, a bibliomaniac can improve overall well-being by sharing the love. Losing copy 10 hurts less than gaining copy 1 helps.</p>
<h1 id="visualizing-the-utilitarian-consequences-of-income-distribution">Visualizing the utilitarian consequences of income distribution</h1>
<p>We can start to build a visual intuition for this instrumental egalitarianism. Suppose we have an income distribution that looks like this:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<form>
<fieldset class="draw">
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Income in dollars by percentile for hypothetical population</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="income-distribution">

</div>
</figure>
<button type="button">
<p>Clear</p>
</button>
</fieldset>
</form>
<p>And suppose that the marginal utility of the last dollar of income looks like this:</p>
<form>
<fieldset class="draw">
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Hypothetical marginal utility of last dollar over a range of incomes</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="marginal-utility">

</div>
</figure>
<button type="button">
<p>Clear</p>
</button>
</fieldset>
</form>
<p>Then, via some math (check <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/utilitarian-egalitarianism-notebook/">the preceding post</a> for details), we can figure out the utility across the population:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Utility by percentile for hypothetical populations based on income distribution and marginal utility of money.</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="utility-distribution">

</div>
</figure>
<p>In addition to showing the utility distribution for the income distribution specified in the first chart, we also show the utility distribution of a hypothetical perfectly egalitarian population (with the same total income). Finally, the dashed lines show the mean utility in each population.</p>
<p>The default functions plotted in the first two charts (income distribution and marginal utility of last dollar) are merely suggestive and the true fact of the matter is empirically determined. If you don’t like the suggestions, feel free to draw in your own functions (click and drag). The final chart showing the population utility distribution will update accordingly.</p>
<p>Some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>See what happens when you draw in a more aggressively inegalitarian income distribution</li>
<li>See what happens when you draw in an egalitarian income distribution</li>
<li>See what happens when you draw in constant marginal returns</li>
<li>See what happens when you draw in increasing marginal returns</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>For any given level of total income, diminishing marginal returns imply that an egalitarian distribution of that income produces greater average and total utility. This is reflected visually by the dashed mean for the inegalitarian utility distribution being below the dashed mean for the egalitarian utility distribution.</p>
<h1 id="caveats">Caveats</h1>
<p>The presentation here is highly simplified in a way that’s probably misleading. Some complications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Income isn’t the only source of utility. To the extent that other sources of utility are uncorrelated with income, acknowledging other contributors to utility would tend to reduce the relative importance of inequality. For example, if income accounted for only 10% of people’s utility, even radical inequality would mean only a relatively minor missed opportunity.</li>
<li>Diminishing marginal utility isn’t the only route by which inequality may affect utility. People may have direct preferences about the income distribution (i.e. envy and resentment). The impact of this on our analysis depends on the nature of these preferences. If people’s preferences are sensitive to absolute differences in terms of dollars, our story so far understates the importance of equality. If their preferences are sensitive only to their rank in the overall distribution, most egalitarian improvements are irrelevant so this consideration can be omitted.</li>

<p>Reductive summary of claims: It’s not that the core principles of economic theory are wrong. The problem comes when we apply those principles with insufficient imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
“But isn’t economics a science, and aren’t you one of its most distinguished practitioners? Even though you do not know much about our economy, surely there are some general theories and prescriptions you can share with us to guide our economic policies and reforms.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
So [the visiting economist] begins. The efficiency with which an economy’s resources are allocated is a critical determinant of the economy’s performance, he says. Efficiency, in turn, requires aligning the incentives of households and businesses with social costs and benefits. The incentives faced by entrepreneurs, investors, and producers are particularly important when it comes to economic growth. Growth needs a system of property rights and contract enforcement that will ensure those who invest can retain the returns on their investments. And the economy must be open to ideas and innovations from the rest of the world.

<blockquote>
By the time the economist stops, it appears as if he has laid out a full-fledged neoliberal agenda. A critic in the audience will have heard all the code words: efficiency, incentives, property rights, sound money, fiscal prudence. Yet the universal principles that the economist describes are in fact quite open-ended. … And therein lies the central conceit, and the fatal flaw, of neoliberalism: the belief that first-order economic principles map onto a unique set of policies, approximated by a Thatcher–Reagan-style agenda.

<p>Briefly, a scenario (<span class="noted">canonically, a distribution of resources across individuals</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto optimal</a> in a set of scenarios if no other scenario is weakly preferred by <em>all</em> individuals (to be more precise, scenario A is a Pareto improvement over scenario B if no individual prefers scenario B to scenario A and at least one individual prefers scenario A). An immediate consequence of this definition is that Pareto improvement is a strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial order</a>. That is, in opposition to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a>, not all pairs of scenarios can be ranked; sometimes we can only throw up our hands and say, “I don’t know which is better. They both count as Pareto optimal.”</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch.
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that, <span class="noted">in common use</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the term ‘tyranny of the majority’ conflates two importantly distinct concepts.</p>
<h1 id="invidious">Invidious</h1>
<p>The first sense in which one can mean tyranny of the majority is the one highlighted in the epigraph. In this form, some passing whim of the majority overrules and outweighs the critical interest of the minority. The wolves’ purely gustatory (pretending that wolves aren’t obligate carnivores) interest in the lamb trumps the lamb’s literally vital interest in living. Real world examples in this category include: <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws">Jim Crow laws</a></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage">marriage for same-sex couples</a>; often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">Nimbyism</a>.</p>
<h1 id="a-shift-in-perspective">A shift in perspective</h1>
<p>Tyranny of the majority is often framed as a majority violating the political and moral rights of the minority. Once we permit ourselves the ontological spookiness that is ‘rights’, it seems only fair to allow ourselves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory#Interpersonal_utility_comparison">interpersonal utility comparison</a>. With these tools, we can reframe and make precise the tyranny of the majority described above.</p>
<p>Invidious tyranny of the majority occurs when the weak preferences of many outweigh the strong preferences of the few such that <span class="noted">the actual outcome doesn’t maximize utility/satisfaction of preferences</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For example, the lamb gets -10 utils from being eaten. Each wolf gets 2 utils from eating the lamb. The aggregate net utility of eating the lamb is -6, but their are two votes for and only 1 against. On the other hand, if the wolves were fanatical gourmands that each got 15 utils from eating the lamb, <span class="noted">we wouldn’t call their feast a tyranny of the majority</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In symbols,</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/-2878446764376890000.svg" title="
d_{v} = \text{argmax}_{d \in D} \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} v(\theta, d) \\
d_{u} = \text{argmax}_{d \in D} \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} u(\theta, d)
" /></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the set of all possible outcomes/policies, <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> is the set of all voters, <span class="math inline">\(v(\theta, d)\)</span> is either <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> based on whether <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> votes for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(u(\theta, d)\)</span> is between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> based on how much utility <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> gets from <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Tyranny of the majority occurs when <span class="math inline">\(d_{v}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{u}\)</span> disagree even for honest voters (i.e. those that don’t try to pursue any strategy but just vote their preferences in the most naive way possible).</p>
<h1 id="innocuous">Innocuous</h1>
<p>From this perspective, it becomes clearer what in innocuous majoritarian tyranny is. It’s when individuals in the majority care about the outcome less than the minority, but honoring the majority’s preferences still maximizes aggregate utility. (Presumably/hopefully, no one cries “tyranny” when the majority both has more numbers <em>and</em> cares more.)</p>
<p>If you have 10 wolves, each of whom get 2 utils from eating the original lamb, the aggregate utility of eating the lamb is 10 (<span class="math inline">\(10 * 2 - 10 = 10\)</span>) versus 0 for abstaining. Thus, eating maximizes overall utility despite the fact that individual preference of each wolf is weaker than the lamb’s.</p>
<p>In symbols, an innocuous tyranny is when <span class="math inline">\(d_{v} = d_{u}\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\theta \in \Theta_{M}} \frac{u(\theta, d_{v})}{\norm{\Theta_{M}}} &lt; \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_{m}} \frac{u(\theta, d’)}{\norm{\Theta_{m}}}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_{M}\)</span> is the set of voters in the majority, <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_{m}\)</span> is the set of voters in the minority, and <span class="math inline">\(d’\)</span> is the minority’s preferred outcome.</p>
<p>Obviously, calling this situation innocuous is tendentious and I’m not about run out and slaughter lambs based on this logic. The logic outlined here ignores classic objects to utilitarianism like the ‘separateness of persons’. But I think utilitarians at least would be on board with majority rule in ‘innocuous’ scenario whereas I think zero (?) theories of the good would support the invidious tyranny of the majority.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To summarize, we call it a ‘tyranny of the majority’ when the minority has stronger preferences than the majority which aren’t honored. This tyranny is invidious if allowing the majority to overrule the minority doesn’t maximize aggregate utility. It’s innocuous if allowing the majority to overrule the minority does maximize aggregate utility (i.e. the majority is big enough).</p>

<p>Reductive summary of claims: Positive impacts of direct cash transfers attenuate considerably over time. Negative spillover effects for non-recipients are substantial.</p>
<blockquote>
Comparing recipients households to non-recipients in distant villages, we find that recipients of cash transfers have 40% more assets than control households three years post transfer. This amount (USD 422 PPP) is equivalent to 60% of the initial transfer (USD 709 PPP). However, we do not find statistically significant across-village treatment effects on other outcomes. This difference could stem … from potential spillover effects at the village level. Indeed, non-recipient households in treatment villages show differences to pure control households on several dimensions. The point estimates suggest spillover households spend USD 30 PPP less than pure control households, or about 16% based on a pure control mean of USD 188 PPP, and score ~0.25 SD less on an index of food security than pure control households. Spillover households also score ˜0.18 SD less on an index of psychological wellbeing than pure control households.

<blockquote>
The magnitude of the income gains of the “best you can do” via direct interventions to raise the income of the poor in situ is about 40 times smaller than the income gain from allowing people from those same poor countries to work in a high productivity country like the USA. Simply allowing more labor mobility holds vastly more promise for reducing poverty than anything else on the development agenda.

<p>Overall, I think the essay doesn’t do much to support the titular claim. The closest it gets is a couple paragraphs in the middle stating, “The industry exploits complex, sentient beings as resources, which is a woefully inefficient process.” I’d certainly be interested in hearing a more compelling argument on this topic (i.e. animal welfare arguments that are justified solely in terms of benefits to <em>homo sapiens</em>). Pointers?</p></li>

    <title>A lazy approach to AI safety</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to most ethical theories, the actions of any AI agent we create have moral import. To accommodate this reality, we guide the agent with a utility function and (implicitly or explicitly) an ethical framework.</p>
<p>One of the key problems of AI alignment is that we are uncertain about which ethical theory to encode in the agent because we (philosophers, humans, society) are ourselves unsure of the correct ethical theory. How can we expect our agent to act in accordance with our values when we don’t even know what our values are?</p>
<p>I propose that we wave the white flag of surrender in the battle to find final, certain answers to the hard problems of ethics. Instead, we should reify our uncertainty and our search procedures in agents we build.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="ethical-surrender">Ethical surrender</h1>
<p>Our prior should be that “solving” ethics is hard: Many smart people have worked on it for centuries. We can also take a step back and allude to more <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/">fundamental limitations to knowledge</a> which suggest a definitive solution to ethics isn’t around the corner.</p>
<p>There is a certain simplicity to the empirical domain. We can see it, taste it, feel it. And yet, the possibility of certain, empirical knowledge has faced strong skepticism from philosophers for centuries (dating at least to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/">David Hume</a>). Do we simplify the problem of induction by moving to the abstracted domain of ethics? It seems doubtful.</p>
<p>If induction is out, what about deduction? Again, there are <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/">limits</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this section is brief and handwavey. We’ve sidestepped big, intricate arguments about the nature of ethics and moral epistemology. But I hope it primes your intuition enough that you’re willing to provisionally accept that uncertainty is a major feature of ethics now and in the future.</p>
<h1 id="moral-uncertainty">Moral uncertainty</h1>
<p>Once we accept this uncertainty, we must choose how to respond. If we don’t reflect on the idea of moral uncertainty, our approach is likely to approximate “my favorite theory” <span class="citation" data-cites="gustafsson2014">(Gustafsson and Torpman <a href="#ref-gustafsson2014">2014</a>)</span>. In this approach, we weigh the options, find whichever ethical theory fares best, and discard the rest. That is, if, after analysis, we think the categorical imperative is 20% likely to be true and utilitarianism is 80% likely to be true, we act as utilitarians.</p>
<p>A compelling alternative is to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html">retain our uncertainty and evaluate actions against a weighted parliament of ethical theories</a>. In our 80-20 scenario above, any action is evaluated against both theories. If utilitarianism marginally prefers action B to A while the categorical imperative heavily favors A over B, we do A (even though we are “mostly” utilitarian!).</p>
<h2 id="moral-uncertainty-in-machines">Moral uncertainty in machines</h2>
<p>The impression I have (admittedly, mostly from afar) is that AI alignment has mostly (implicitly) revolved around the “my favorite theory” approach. That is, people have been approaching the issue as deciding which single ethical theory they will encode in an agent. Until they’re certain they’ve decided upon the “one true theory” of ethics, all powerful agents are the stuff of nightmares. I think the parliamentary model improves on this situation.</p>
<p>When encoding the parliamentary model in machines, <span class="noted">there’s good reason to avoid simply transferring our own intuitions and perspectives into the machine</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Instead, the parliament’s initial distribution should probably be set by a <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution">maximum entropy distribution</a></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>—that is each ethical theory starts with equal likelihood. Of course, we can’t leave it there.</p>
<p>Instead, we will allow and expect our agent to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayesian updates</a> to reweight the moral parliament. That is, in addition to any actions it can take in the world (e.g. an autonomous car turning left, a paperclip factory agent reconfiguring its supply chain. For lack of familiarity with a better term, we’ll call actions-in-the-world “interventions” henceforth), the agent also always has the option of performing ethical investigation. This supposes that we have a workable answer to the questions of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/">moral epistemology</a> and thus a well-founded way to perform these updates. We’ll bracket the question of how exactly this can be done while noting that moral epistemology is at least a different hard problem to solve than the problem which AI alignment typically confronts.</p>
<h3 id="necessity-of-agent-embedding">Necessity of agent embedding</h3>
<p>The above sounds like a generic algorithm for ethical investigation. Why embed it in an agent rather than asking it to run “to completion” and using the result, or creating a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6SGqkCgHuNr7d4yJm/thoughts-on-the-singularity-institute-si">tool AI</a>? Under most plausible moral epistemes, I suspect running “to completion” would be <span class="noted">computationally intractable</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. On the subject of tool AIs, I’ll leave it to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI">Why tool AIs want to be agent AIs</a> and note that foundational ethical investigation seems like a bad place to skimp on capability.</p>
<h1 id="arbitrating-between-interventions-and-investigations">Arbitrating between interventions and investigations</h1>
<p>How should ethical investigation be valued in the agent’s utility function? We must answer this question before our agent can make appropriate trade-offs between intervention and ethical investigation. Once we see the ethical investigation as an information-gathering task, the solution falls out naturally. We should use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information">value of information calculations</a> to value ethical investigation.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/value-of-information-calculator-explained/">value of information</a> is a well-founded way of quantifying our intuition that uncertainty has a cost. When our actions result in uncertain outcomes, we muddle through as best we can. But information that reduces the uncertainty associated with an action has a tangible value—it may actually cause us to change our actions and obtain better outcomes. If a rational decision maker would pay up to $X for this information, then we say it has a value of $X.</p>
<p>In this case, the value in our value of information calculation is determined by our parliament of moral theories. This is circular (and thus a bit confusing), but, I think, can be <span class="noted">made to work</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>. So we’d expect our agent to perform ethical investigation <span class="noted">only insofar as the information produced by that investigation might affect interventions under consideration</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> and where the value of that information is greater than any currently available intervention.</p>
<h1 id="claimed-benefits">Claimed benefits</h1>
<h2 id="ai-arms-race">AI arms race</h2>
<p>In an AI arms race, the naive approach to alignment—first, solve ethics; then, develop AGI—puts the most scrupulous developers at a disadvantage <span class="citation" data-cites="armstrong2016">(Armstrong, Bostrom, and Shulman <a href="#ref-armstrong2016">2016</a>)</span>. Because the costs of scrupulosity are so high, we expect most developers to end up in the ‘unscrupulous’ category. The lazy approach may offer a significant advantage here. Because the approach is conceptually straightforward, implementation could be relatively manageable. As such, asking all agent creators to include it is a more plausible request than demanding the cessation of all agent development. Furthermore, when an agent finds itself doing trivial actions of no moral import, it can remain fairly disinterested in ethics. Broad approximations of ethical truth suffice. This means agent creators working in certain fields can be fairly confident that the run time costs—in terms of agent performance overhead, constraints on agent actions, agent predictability, etc.—are minimal. Again, this makes ethical consideration cheaper and more likely.</p>
<h2 id="ambiguity-alignment">Ambiguity alignment</h2>
<p>All the moral conundrums that we humans confront are now moral conundrums for our agent as well. When it is faced with truly difficult and important moral decisions, rather than blithely running ahead, our agent will be prompted to pause and refine its ethical views. We can even imagine moral epistemes in which human intuition is a vital input so our agent would actively seek human advice precisely when we are most afraid of alien intelligence.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="predominate" class="arg-map">predominance of capital-managed firms (CMF) over worker cooperatives (WC)</a> remains an open question in economics. Early explanations relied on a hypothesized comparative inefficiency of cooperatives. Subsequent empirical study has shown that <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="efficient" class="arg-map">cooperatives are at least as efficient as capital-managed firms</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="doucouliagos95">(Doucouliagos <a href="#ref-doucouliagos95">1995</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="estrin87">(Estrin, Jones, and Svejnar <a href="#ref-estrin87">1987</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="craig95">(Craig et al. <a href="#ref-craig95">1995</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="levine90">(Levine <a href="#ref-levine90">1990</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A profusion of hypotheses has since arisen. <span class="citation" data-cites="dow99">(Dow and Putterman <a href="#ref-dow99">1999</a>)</span> offers a good summary (though the term must be used loosely for a 126-page paper). One that I have not seen presented is: <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="hypothesis" class="arg-map">capital-managed firms predominate because capitalists have a greater incentive to expand than worker-owners in worker cooperatives</a>. Roughly, for each market segment a capitalist expands into, their income increases by capital’s share of the new segment’s profit. For each market segment a cooperative expands into, the expanders receive no direct remuneration (supposing that the new market segment is also a cooperative). Any new profit goes to worker-owners in the new segment.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="cellular-automaton">Cellular automaton</h1>
<p>We can make this hypothesis more tangible by representing it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a>. <span class="noted"><a href="#cooperatives-map" id="automaton-link" class="arg-map">In this automaton</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="segment" class="arg-map">each cell represents a market segment requiring a fixed quantity of labor and capital</a>. Adjacent cells represent similar market segments.</p>
<div id="automaton">

</div>
<h2 id="initial-conditions">Initial conditions</h2>
<p>In the beginning, the market is filled with <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="empty" class="arg-map">empty market segments which have a random cost</a> (represented in the automaton by the opacity of the <span class="empty">red cell interiors</span>) for a firm to expand into.</p>
<h2 id="step">Step</h2>
<h3 id="occupied-market-segments">Occupied market segments</h3>
<p>In each step, an existing firm may go bankrupt (or exit the market segment in some other way) with fixed probability <span class="math inline">\(B = 0.1\)</span>. If a firm goes bankrupt, its market segment becomes empty once again.</p>
<p>If it does not go bankrupt, <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="accum" class="arg-map">the profits generated during that step are distributed</a>. For worker cooperatives, all profits accrue to the worker-owners within the cooperative. For capital-managed segments, labor’s share of income (estimated at 70% <span class="citation" data-cites="karabarbounis13">(Karabarbounis and Neiman <a href="#ref-karabarbounis13">2013</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="gomme04">(Gomme and Rupert <a href="#ref-gomme04">2004</a>)</span>) accrues to the segment’s workers and capital’s share of income accrues to the capitalists of the segment’s firm.</p>
<p>The accumulated income of workers in a capital-managed segment is represented in the automaton by opacity of the <span class="capital">purple cell interior</span>. The accumulated income of the capitalists (of a given firm) is represented by the opacity of the <span class="capital">purple cell border</span> enclosing all segments owned by the firm. The accumulated income of worker-owners in a worker cooperative is represented in the automaton by the opacity of the <span class="labor">green cell interior</span>. Worker cooperatives sharing an ancestor (e.g. cooperative B and C were both founded by cooperative A) are enclosed by a single border.</p>
<h3 id="empty-market-segments">Empty market segments</h3>
<p>In each step, an empty market segment may be occupied by <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="firm" class="arg-map">a newly formed firm</a> with chance <span class="math inline">\(N = 0.001\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also, in each step, <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="expand" class="arg-map">an empty market segment may be subject to expansion</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">adjacent firms</a>. Each adjacent firm has a 20% chance of attempting expansion (representing market conditions, firm conditions, &amp;c.). The cost of expansion into the market segment must be less than the accumulated income of the expander and less than the projected value of the segment. In the event of multiple firms competing to expand into a single segment, the firm with the greatest valuation for the segment succeeds.</p>
<p>Valuations are determined thus:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Capital-managed firm</dt>
<dd>The total value a capital-management firm can expect to extract from a segment takes the form <span class="math inline">\(KP + KP(1 - B)(1 - D) + KP(1 - B)^2(1 - D)^2 + \ldots\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is capital’s share of income, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the per-step profit, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the bankruptcy rate, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the firm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value">discount rate</a> (ranging uniformly from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>). Using the formula for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula">geometric series</a>, we can write this as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{KP}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)}\)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Worker cooperative</dt>
<dd>Similarly, the total value a worker cooperative can expect to extract from a segment takes the form <span class="math inline">\(\frac{AS}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(S = GP - LP\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the productivity advantage of worker cooperatives (set to 1.1 in the automaton) and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is labor’s share of income, represents the comparative benefit for worker-owners in a worker cooperative over being laborers in a capital-managed firm. <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="altruism" class="arg-map"><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (“altruism”) represents the extent to which the expanding worker cooperative cares about these potential gains.</a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A quick consequence of this model is that worker cooperatives and capital-managed firms will value expansions equally (assuming equal discount and bankruptcy rates) when</p>

<p>You can reorganize the graph by dragging a node to fix it into a position. For example, if you were skipping around in a large document, you could track which sections you’d read by dragging their nodes to the right margin. Double-clicking releases a node that’s been fixed in place.</p>

<p>There are a variety of citation-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics">bibliometrics</a>. The current <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="impact" class="arg-map">dominant metric</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor">impact factor</a>.

Consequently, academics take impact factor into account throughout the planning, execution and reporting of a study <span class="citation" data-cites="plos06">(Editors <a href="#ref-plos06">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_law">Campbell’s law</a> in action. Because average citation count isn’t what we actually value, when it becomes the metric by which decisions are made, it distorts academic research. In the rest of this post, I propose a bibliometric that measures the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy reduction</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">research graph</a>.</p>

<h1 id="entropy-header">Entropy</h1>
<p>Claude Shannon <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="entropy" class="arg-map">codified entropy</a> as <span class="math inline">\(H(X) = -\sum\limits_{i} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> are the possible values of a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="shannon48">(Shannon <a href="#ref-shannon48">1948</a>)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="cover12">(Cover and Thomas <a href="#ref-cover12">2012</a>)</span>. For example, the entropy of a 6-sided die is <img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/906174370527848253.svg" title="\begin{align}
  H(D) &amp;= - P(⚀) \log_2 P(⚀) - P(⚁) \log_2 P(⚁) - P(⚂) \log_2 P(⚂) \\
       &amp; - P(⚃) \log_2 P(⚃) - P(⚄) \log_2 P(⚄) - P(⚅) \log_2 P(⚅) \\
       &amp;= -\left(6 \left(\frac{1}{6} \log_2 \frac{1}{6}\right)\right) \\
       &amp;= \log_2 6
\end{align}" />.</p>
<p>If we next learn that the die is weighted and can only roll even numbers, this changes the entropy (our uncertainty).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/-6310274088524152858.svg" title="\begin{align}
H(D|\epsilon) &amp;= - P(⚁) \log_2 P(⚁) -
                   P(⚃) \log_2 P(⚃) -
                   P(⚅) \log_2 P(⚅) \\
     &amp;= - \left(3 \left(\frac{1}{3} \log_2 \frac{1}{3}\right)\right) \\
     &amp;= \log_2 3
\end{align}" /></p>
<p><span class="noted">So the reduction in uncertainty is <span class="math inline">\(H(D) - H(D|\epsilon) = \log_2 6 - \log_2 3 = 1\)</span>.</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>We can use these definitions to calculate the information provided by a research paper and assign an Infometric®™ score. We’ll start with a fairly classic example about cigarette smoking.</p>
<h2 id="first-study">First study</h2>
<p>Suppose <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="single" class="arg-map">we do a study</a> on whether, in the normal course of smoking, cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs (we’ll call this proposition <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>). Prior to the study we use the (extremely) uninformative prior <span class="math inline">\(\cond{P}{A=t}{} = 0.5\)</span>. After the study (which we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) we perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayesian update</a> and find that <span class="math inline">\(\cond{P}{A=t}{\alpha} = 0.8\)</span>. So our study has provided</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/5273260164788045100.svg" title="\begin{align}
H(A) - \cond{H}{A}{\alpha} &amp;= -P(A=t)\log_2P(A=t) - P(A=f)\log_2P(A=f) \\
  &amp;+ \cond{P}{A=t}{\alpha}\log_2\cond{P}{A=t}{\alpha} \\
  &amp;+ \cond{P}{A=f}{\alpha}\log_2\cond{P}{A=f}{\alpha} \\
  &amp;= -0.5\log_20.5 \\
  &amp;- 0.5\log_20.5 \\
  &amp;+ 0.8\log_20.8 \\
  &amp;+ 0.2\log_20.2 \\
  &amp;\approx 0.278
\end{align}" /></p>
<p>bits of entropy reduction. Thus its score at the moment is <span class="math inline">\(0.278\)</span>. So far, so good?</p>
<h2 id="second-study">Second study</h2>
<p>Now, we wish to study whether smoking causes chronic bronchitis. Suppose the study we design pipes smoke directly into the lungs of experimental subjects. The validity of our conclusion (Smoking does (not) cause chronic bronchitis.) now depends on the truth of the claim that cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs. So this new study is dependent on the prior study and will cite it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/bibliometric/bronchitis-pre.svg" alt="We are using uninformative priors. ¶ (In this and subsequent graphs, we follow the conventions of ¶ Bayesian networks (i.e. a cited paper is the parent rather than the child—the arrow runs from rather than to the cited paper) rather than the conventions of citation graphs.)" width="300" height="300" /><figcaption>We are using uninformative priors. ¶ (In this and subsequent graphs, we follow the conventions of ¶ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian networks</a> (i.e. a cited paper is the parent rather than the child—the arrow runs from rather than to the cited paper) rather than the conventions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_graph">citation graphs</a>.)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now we carry out our study. It provides evidence that cigarette smoking does lead to bronchitis (conditional on the supposition that cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs). So we update our <span class="math inline">\(\cond{P}{B=t}{\beta}\)</span>. The entropy reduction from this study, considered in isolation, is <span class="math inline">\(H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} \approx 0.266\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/bibliometric/bronchitis-post.svg" alt="We have integrated data from the second study." width="300" height="300" /><figcaption>We have integrated data from the second study.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But what if we don’t consider it in isolation? First, we look for the total entropy reduction from both studies and find <span class="math inline">\(H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} \approx 0.703\)</span>. <span class="noted">Note that this is not simply the sum of the isolated reductions.</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/bibliometric/bronchitis-both.svg" alt="We have integrated data from both studies now." width="300" height="300" /><figcaption>We have integrated data from both studies now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>How do we apportion this gain into Infometric®™ scores then? We can decompose the aggregate gain into a sum like</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/1681010744790707563.svg" title="\begin{align}
H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} &amp;=
    \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} \\
  &amp;+ H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta}
\end{align}" /></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} \approx 0.437\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’s score and <span class="math inline">\(H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} \approx 0.266\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s score.</p>
<p>(the general form is <span class="math inline">\(H(S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n) - \cond{H}{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n}{\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\cdots,\sigma_n} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n I(\sigma_i))\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I(\sigma_i) = \cond{H}{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_i}{\sigma_{i+1},\sigma_{i+2},\cdots,\sigma_n} - \cond{H}{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_i}{\sigma_i,\sigma_{i+1},\sigma_{i+2},\cdots,\sigma_n}\)</span></p>
<p>We can see that <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> citing <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> has increased <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’s score (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> now reduces our uncertainty not only about <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, but also about <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), a “citation bonus”. Or, if you prefer, you can think of it as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> capturing the externalities it generates in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-study">Fourth study</h2>
<p>We’ll now jump to <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="four" class="arg-map">a fourth study</a> so we can examine a fuller set of interactions (i.e. multiples studies citing one study, one study citing multiple studies).</p>

The human race, to which so many of my readers belong, has been playing at children’s games from the beginning…. And one of the games to which it is most attached is called “Keep to-morrow dark,” …. The players listen very carefully and respectfully to all that the clever men have to say about what is to happen in the next generation. The players then wait until all the clever men are dead, and bury them nicely. They then go and do something else. That is all. For a race of simple tastes, however, it is great fun. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="chesterton04">(Chesterton <a href="#ref-chesterton04">1904</a>)</span></span>

<p>“Alright, 70% chance.”</p>
<p>“Also, note that people are pretty bad at predictions. A study by George Wise found that <span class="noted"><a href="#futurism-map" id="mediocre" class="arg-map">out of 1556 naive medium-term predictions made publicly by Americans between 1890 and 1940, just under 40% had been fulfilled or were in progress by 1976</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="wise76">(Wise <a href="#ref-wise76">1976</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Then I won’t just make a reflexive prediction. I’ll give the matter serious thought… Well, <a href="#futurism-map" id="single" class="arg-map">people in the future will probably be really into opera and the arts because shiny, metal robots will do all the real work. So they’ll be sitting on their hover chairs in their spandex togas. And they’ll want to listen to something—but see something at the same time—just like laser light shows. But lasers will be pretty blasé in the future (what with the ubiquitous laser pocket knifes, laser watches, and laser pointers). So holophonors will be the perfect thing. So, I guess a 90% chance of holophonors?</a>”</p>
<p>“Ah ha ha. You fell right into my trap! Your casual futurism betrays you! Just by imagining that scenario, you think it’s more likely.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it was a persuasively coherent reverie. My holophonor scenario was pretty airtight. That doesn’t sound so bad to be convinced by an exceptionally plausible scenarios…. Wait, what happened with those told to imagine Ford winning?”</p>
<p>“I think you can guess. They became more certain that Ford would win. He got pretty similar results when he asked students to predict the success of the University of Pittsburgh’s football team after having some of the students imagine a good season and some imagine a bad season. Carroll concluded, ‘The objective fact that some events are imaginary, hypothetical, inferred rather than observed … is poorly coded or not properly used. Thus, the act of posing a problem or asking a question could itself change the beliefs of subjects.’”</p>
<p>“It could be worse. I could believe in something absurd—like a future with no holophonors. Out of all possible scenarios, I described the most plausible.”</p>
<p>“Nope. <a href="#futurism-map" id="optimistic" class="arg-map">People’s default, ‘realistic’ predictions are pretty much just their most optimistic predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="buehler94">(Buehler, Griffin, and Ross <a href="#ref-buehler94">1994</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="newby00">(Newby-Clark et al. <a href="#ref-newby00">2000</a>)</span>.</a>”</p>
<p>“But how common is this problem? It seems like you just tricked me into a vivid visualization.”</p>
<p>“Not so much. Constructing details and filling in gaps is an almost inevitable part of any serious prediction effort <span class="citation" data-cites="griffin90">(Griffin, Dunning, and Ross <a href="#ref-griffin90">1990</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“Alright, you smug snake. I give up. I can’t just reflexively shout out a number and trying to think about the prediction in detail only makes matters worse. What should I do then? How do I see into the future?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’m not sure. Since naive methods seem to fare so dismally, we should probably use some sort of system. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of empirical evidence on effective forecasting techniques.”</p>
<p>“Presumably we want to minimize all these biases, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. There a lot of techniques to choose from though <span class="citation" data-cites="tag04">(Group <a href="#ref-tag04">2004</a>)</span>. Since we’re just a couple of schlemiels, we can’t really call up a panel of experts for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method">Delphi method</a>. And for a lot of the mathematical models, ‘even the relevant variables are not known, let alone the linkages between the variables.’ <span class="citation" data-cites="martino03">(Martino <a href="#ref-martino03">2003</a>)</span> If we feel we must forecast, the best general-purpose technique might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning">scenario planning</a>.”</p>
<p>“I thought you just got done scolding me for scenarios!”</p>
<p>“I did. But the distinguishing feature of scenario planning (a term of art) is a semi-rigorized approach to <a href="#futurism-map" id="multiple" class="arg-map">generating fundamentally divergent, coherent narratives of the future.</a> Proponents suggest the consideration of multiple scenarios is salubrious.”</p>
<p>“Are they right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. As I lamented already, evidence is sparse. And a lot of that evidence relies on self-report about the decision process. ‘Since [decision] outcome is often difficult to evaluate the … process perspective has become the major stream of research on decision quality.’ <span class="citation" data-cites="meissner13">(Meissner and Wulf <a href="#ref-meissner13">2013</a>)</span>”</p>
<p>“That sounds problematic, since your major contention is the dominating role of bias.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. But the outcome evidence that exists does seem to suggest that scenario planning is a bit better than naive methods. Whether it’s actually satisfactory…”</p>
<p>“Good news first. What’s the evidence in favor of scenario planning?”</p>
<p>“The most direct evidence of outcome efficacy comes from three researchers at the University of Surrey <span class="citation" data-cites="phelps01">(Phelps, Chan, and Kapsalis <a href="#ref-phelps01">2001</a>)</span>. They performed an observational study of information technology companies in the UK. After sampling, they looked at 50 companies using scenario planning and 50 that didn’t. <a href="#futurism-map" id="outcomes" class="arg-map">The companies using scenario planning showed significantly greater growth in profits and return on capital employed,</a> though they did not show significantly greater growth in clients. They did a similar study with 22 water companies. Here, there was no significant relationship between scenario planning and the performance variables.”</p>
<p>“Hm. What’s the other ‘favorable’ evidence?”</p>
<p>“In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design">repeated measures study</a>, researchers found that <a href="#futurism-map" id="widened" class="arg-map">scenario planning widened 50% and 90% confidence intervals on personally important strategic measures</a> by 56% and 44% respectively <span class="citation" data-cites="schoemaker93">(Schoemaker <a href="#ref-schoemaker93">1993</a>)</span>. However, they also found that <a href="#futurism-map" id="narrowed" class="arg-map">when asked to construct extreme scenarios (judged as implausible), ranges actually contracted.</a>”</p>
<p>“So whether scenario planning increases or decreases confidence intervals depends on which scenarios are constructed.”</p>
<p>“Yep. In an experimental study of graduate management students planning for a case company, <a href="#futurism-map" id="framing" class="arg-map">students who went through a full scenario planning process showed no evidence of the</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)">framing bias</a></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="meissner13">(Meissner and Wulf <a href="#ref-meissner13">2013</a>)</span>. Students that went through only the initial part of the scenario process, but didn’t actually generate scenarios, still showed susceptibility to the framing bias. However, students that used <a href="#futurism-map" id="other" class="arg-map">traditional strategic planning tools</a> (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_five_forces_analysis">Porter’s five forces</a>) were also effectively debiased. Other researchers even suggest that directions akin to ‘think harder’ are sufficient to defeat the framing bias <span class="citation" data-cites="wright02">(Wright and Goodwin <a href="#ref-wright02">2002</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“What else?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty much all I could muster in favor of scenario planning. Of pretty fundamental concern for scenario planning is evidence that generating multiple scenarios doesn’t alter point predictions. Researchers did a study in which they asked university students to estimate when they’d complete school assignments and then followed-up to determine the actual completion times <span class="citation" data-cites="newby00">(Newby-Clark et al. <a href="#ref-newby00">2000</a>)</span>. Through a variety of experimental permutations, they concluded that, ‘<a href="#futurism-map" id="pessimistic" class="arg-map">Participants’ final task completion time estimates were not affected when they generated pessimistic scenarios … in combination with more optimistic scenarios.</a> … [R]egardless of plausibility, predictors did not attend to pessimistic scenarios.’ Similar results were found by Paul Schoemaker <span class="citation" data-cites="schoemaker92">(Schoemaker and Heijden <a href="#ref-schoemaker92">1992</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“Any more?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A quasi-experimental study of managers found that <a href="#futurism-map" id="rational" class="arg-map">scenario planning decreased rational decision-making and increased intuitive decision-making</a> as measured by the General Decision-Making Style Survey <span class="citation" data-cites="chermack08">(Chermack and Nimon <a href="#ref-chermack08">2008</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like it could be conducive to biases.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Ronald Bradfield offers a pretty harsh indictment of scenario planning <span class="citation" data-cites="bradfield08">(Bradfield <a href="#ref-bradfield08">2008</a>)</span>. He observed five groups of five or six postgraduate students developing scenarios for a designated organization. He observed that, for each group, their starting point determined which factors were subsequently explored in scenarios and this starting point was essentially determined by events highly publicized in the media like avian influenza and stem cell research. When countervailing evidence was introduced or alternate developments were suggested, the groups generally discarded them, returning to a ‘common … midpoint of events that were expected to occur’. Bradfield concluded that ‘there was no evidence of the so-called out of the box thinking in the scenarios and there were no strategic insights as to how the future might evolve in new and unprecedented ways’.”</p>
<p>“Is that everything?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty much all the useful information I could find.”</p>
<p>“So where does that leave us?”</p>
<p>“I’m not totally sure. Schoemaker concluded that, ‘Scenarios thus exploit one set of biases (such as the conjunction fallacy and intransitivities of beliefs) to overcome another set, namely overconfidence, anchoring and availability biases.’ <span class="citation" data-cites="schoemaker93">(Schoemaker <a href="#ref-schoemaker93">1993</a>)</span>. Ultimately, scenario planning may be one of the less bad prediction methods.”</p>

<p>When teaching something, is it best to start with concrete and move to the abstract? Or is it best to emphasize the abstract and introduce concrete applications later? Research on this topic is ambivalent <span class="citation" data-cites="flores09">(Flores <a href="#ref-flores09">2009</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="debock11">(De Bock et al. <a href="#ref-debock11">2011</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="kaminski08">(Kaminski, Sloutsky, and Heckler <a href="#ref-kaminski08">2008</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="peterson88">(Peterson, Mercer, and O’Shea <a href="#ref-peterson88">1988</a>)</span>. It’s conceivable that the superior approach depends on the student. With one-on-one in-person instruction, this sort of adaptation is possible. With traditional, static text, it’s not. On the web (with computers generally), it is.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For example (Click one of the arrows on the side to swap the order.):</p>
<p>For each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">natural number</a>, addition with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> produces the same number. For each natural number, multiplication with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> produces the same number.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid">monoid</a> is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element.</p>
<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<p>Now suppose that we wish to make some argument which holds, as a premise, that the state is just and necessary. Because it is not the core of our argument, any argument which convinces the reader to accept that premise suffices. Instead of presenting many arguments equally in the text and implicitly asking the reader to choose, we can make that choice explicit.</p>
<p>For example (Click the highlighted region to bring up a menu. Click one of the options in the menu to activate that choice.):</p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="state">
<div class="open">
<p>The state is a “framework … needed to simplify the application of the two principles of justice”:</p>
<blockquote>
First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others. Second: social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) reasonably expected to be to everyone’s advantage, and (b) attached to positions and offices open to all. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="rawls71">(Rawls <a href="#ref-rawls71">1971</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>(these principles justified by the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/">original position</a>.)</p>

<p>This technique can be found <em>in vivo</em> in <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/quorum/">the post on quorum</a> (which also demonstrates synchronized choice i.e. changing what needs to be changed in subsequent sections to congrue with early choices).</p>

<p>The common element here is that these tools allow for more dialogic text. Instead of fixing one canonical version of the text, we can now, in a limited way, respond to the reader’s preferences.</p>
<p>An alternate view is that these tools allow us to express the structure of our argument with greater fidelity. Traditional text enforces linearity. Structural aspects must be described within the text itself, mixing levels (i.e. we have text which provides the content of our argument interspersed with text which describes the structure of our argument). A standard grammar here could increase both parsimony and efficacy. Viewing the structure of an argument as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a> permits a visualization of the tools described above:</p>

<p>So quorum is a proxy for representativeness. But as the examples demonstrate, it’s, at best, a loose proxy. Sometimes (as in the <a href="#example1">first example</a>) quorum is too demanding—it forbids a decision when the votes endorse one. On other occasions (as in the <a href="#example2">second example</a>), quorum is too lax—it declares representativeness when there can be no certainty of it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative then? How do we determine if a vote is representative? Statistics!</p>
<h1 id="statistics">Statistics</h1>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<h2 id="bayesian">Bayesian</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p>For each pair of alternatives, we’d like to find which of these three is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \gg \mu_2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \approx \mu_1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x \gg y\)</span> means something like “We are justified in believing that <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y\)</span>.” and <span class="math inline">\(x \approx y\)</span> means something like “We aren’t justified in believing that <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y\)</span> or that <span class="math inline">\(y &gt; x\)</span>.”. The first two correspond to quorum and the third corresponds to a failure of quorum.</p>
<p>To establish <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span>, we construct a lower <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credible bound (a one-sided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval">credible interval</a>)</span></span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 - \mu_1\)</span> base on our votes. The lower bound delimits the region where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 - \mu_1\)</span> is largest. If the delimited region includes <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, we must reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span> (i.e. if the region most favorable to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> still doesn’t exclude <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, we aren’t justified in believing <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 &gt; \mu_1\)</span> (at the chosen <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credibility</span></span> level)).</p>
<p>The approach for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \gg \mu_2\)</span> is similar (simply swap in an upper bound or <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>If we reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \gg \mu_2\)</span>, we must accept <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \approx \mu_1\)</span> and declare a failure of quorum.</p>
<p>For example, we’d like to <a href="#quorum-map" id="bayes" class="arg-map">determine if the <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credible</span></span> bounds support the conclusion</a> that buko pie really is preferred to fish pie. If Pie Club bylaws specified a <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credible</span></span> bound and the lower bound for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{buko} - \mu_{fish}\)</span> stretched to <span class="math inline">\(0.359\)</span> while the upper bound stretched to <span class="math inline">\(0.58\)</span>, we’d declare that quorum had been reached in favor of buko pie. (We reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{fish} \gg \mu_{buko}\)</span> because it’s bounded region includes <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We can’t reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{buko} \gg \mu_{fish}\)</span> because it’s bounded region excludes <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.) Alternately, if the lower bound stretched to <span class="math inline">\(-0.1\)</span> and the upper bound stretched to <span class="math inline">\(0.58\)</span>, we’d declare a failure of quorum.</p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<p>How do we construct these credible bounds? We derive them from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability">posterior probability distribution</a> created using Bayesian parameter estimation <span class="citation" data-cites="kruschke13">(Kruschke <a href="#ref-kruschke13">2013</a>)</span>. To construct this posterior, we start by specifying <span class="noted">a model for the distribution of paired differences</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Because the difference can only take on values in the interval <span class="math inline">\(\left(-1, 1\right)\)</span>, the (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-scale_family">transformed</a> from <span class="math inline">\((0, 1)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((-1, 1)\)</span>) <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">beta distribution</a> is a sensible choice</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. To get a sense of the beta distribution, you can look at the calculator <a href="http://keisan.casio.com/has10/SpecExec.cgi?id=system/2006/1180573226">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a model of differences, we must choose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">prior probability distributions</a> for its parameters. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \beta = 1\)</span> collapses the beta distribution to the uniform distribution. Because the uniform distribution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution">maximum entropy distribution</a> on a supported interval, we should choose prior distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> with means of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="sivia06">(Sivia and Skilling <a href="#ref-sivia06">2006</a>)</span>. The maximum entropy distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> supported on <span class="math inline">\(\left(0, \infty\right)\)</span> is the exponential distribution with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 1\)</span>. So the prior on each of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Exp(1)\)</span>. All of this is diagrammatically represented in the accompanying figure.</p>
<figure>

That beta distribution’s parameters have priors of \(Exp(1)\)." /><figcaption>We model the vote differences with a beta distribution. That beta distribution’s parameters have priors of <span class="math inline">\(Exp(1)\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now that we have our data and prior probability distributions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayes’ theorem</a> allows us to reallocate probability mass to form the posterior probability distributions. We generate numerical estimates of the posterior probability distributions using adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts09">(Roberts and Rosenthal <a href="#ref-roberts09">2009</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="sumsar-best">(Bååth <a href="#ref-sumsar-best">2012</a>)</span>. These posteriors on the parameters of beta allow us to straightforwardly calculate the posterior on the mean of the difference using the formula for the mean of a beta distribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="noted">You can try it out below</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Maybe look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scenario in which the quorum status (achieved or failed) depends on the credibility level chosen (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(99\%\)</span>)</li>
<li>Two scenarios in which each alternative retains its mean score, but the quorum status changes</li>
<li>Two scenarios in which the number of voters remains the same, but the quorum status changes</li>
</ul>
<p><em>On the full site, there's an interactive widget here.</em></p>
<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<p>We’ve tacitly <a href="#quorum-map" id="random" class="arg-map">assumed that our actual voters are a random sample</a> of the population of potential voters. This is false (Though one could make it true through adoption of appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition">voting procedures</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias">Self-selection bias</a>, whether due to differential interest, availability, transportation, &amp;c., means that the sample is non-representative. However, the problem of non-random samples also applies to traditional quorum’s assurances of representativeness.</p>
<p>The procedure also accepts the claim of <span class="citation" data-cites="ronr">(Robert, Honemann, and Balch <a href="#ref-ronr">2011</a>)</span> that the purpose of quorum is to ensure representativeness. In consequence, the procedure takes votes as exogenous and characterizes only the resulting information. But one could support quorum for its deliberative, community-building, or even obstructive effects.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="#quorum-map" id="complicated" class="arg-map">isn’t all this math a bit forbidding?</a></p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<p>The conclusions have a rather intuitive interpretation in terms of likelihood, maybe even more intuitive than the traditional quorum interpretation (“We ensure that our decisions are representative by requiring 25% of our members to attend.”). But getting to the conclusions requires a computer and uncommon math.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So this procedure is less accessible than traditional quorum. How much less depends on the relative importances placed on accessible conclusions and accessible process.</p>
<p>Because this calculation is less accessible and will likely be performed by one or a few individuals, it’s import to establish a clear and strict procedure. We should not permit, for example, the choice of modeling distribution after exploratory data analysis. The more degrees of freedom we give the analyst, the more power we give them to influence results <span class="citation" data-cites="simmons11">(Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn <a href="#ref-simmons11">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, this procedure <a href="#quorum-map" id="post-hoc" class="arg-map">admits only post-hoc declarations of quorum</a>. With the traditional procedure, we can just take attendance at a meeting and determine the quorum status for every referendum therein. With the new procedure, after tallying the votes on an issue, we have to run the quorum calculation to retroactively determine quorum if we achieved quorum.</p>
<h1 id="extended-procedures">Extended procedures</h1>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<h2 id="non-parametric">Non-parametric</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the procedure specified above assumes that the paired differences are amenable to modelling by a beta distribution. This leads to overconfident inferences <span class="citation" data-cites="hoeting99">(Hoeting et al. <a href="#ref-hoeting99">1999</a>)</span>. The assumption can be relaxed through the use of Bayesian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics">non-parametric</a> methods <span class="citation" data-cites="walker99">(Walker et al. <a href="#ref-walker99">1999</a>)</span>. The idea is to use a model with an infinite number of parameters and marginalize out surplus dimensions on our finite data.</p>
<h2 id="tying">Tying</h2>
<p>We can also modify the procedure to permit tying. Under standing voting procedures, scores of <span class="math inline">\(0.490\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.488\)</span> produce an identical outcome ( i.e. victory for the first option) to scores of <span class="math inline">\(0.82\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span>. However, if those values are accurate estimates of the population scores (i.e. the uncertainty is small), one could argue that the former scenario suggests a compromise or synthesis position.</p>
<p>By defining “regions of practical equivalence”, parameter estimation allows the possibility of a tie <span class="citation" data-cites="kruschke13">(Kruschke <a href="#ref-kruschke13">2013</a>)</span>. For example, Pie Club could decide that a difference of mean scores smaller than 0.01 counts as a tie. If the credible interval on the difference of means is contained entirely in this region, we don’t have a failure of quorum (uncertainy about which option is preferred), but certainty that neither option is substantially preferred.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-alternatives">Multiple alternatives</h2>
<p>For simplicity, we looked at referenda with only two alternatives. We can extend the procedure to referenda with more alternatives. The most straightforward method would be to apply the procedure described above pairwise. The credibility level would need to adjusted by something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0id%C3%A1k_correction">Šidák correction</a> to deal with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem">problem of multiple comparisons</a>. A better solution would be to perform a Bayesian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance">ANOVA</a> analogue with follow-up tests <span class="citation" data-cites="wetzels12">(Wetzels, Grasman, and Wagenmakers <a href="#ref-wetzels12">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="non-ordinal-outcomes">Non-ordinal outcomes</h2>
<p>The procedure described above applies to ordinal outcomes. That is, we were looking for the alternative with a score higher than all others. If we are trying to assess outcomes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement">a ratio or interval scale</a>, we’d have to use a different procedure.</p>
<p>The appropriate modification depends on the issue at hand. In cases where caution is required, an organization could dispense with quorum and simply use the conservative bound. In other circumstances, an organization could place limits on the maximum size of the interval.</p>
<p>For example, suppose Pie Club put the size of its budget for the next year to a vote. If it were feeling fiscally responsible, it could simply sets its budget to the <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> lower bound on the mean vote. An alternative would be to declare a failure of quorum if the vote didn’t produce a <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> interval smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\mu \pm 10\%\)</span>.</p>
