<blockquote>
Multiple-choice questions are in turn of many kinds; usually they are presented in homogeneous groups. Sometimes a series of statements follows the reading exercise, and the person being tested is asked to indicate which statement best expresses the main idea or ideas of the passage read. In other cases the reader may be offered a choice of statements about a detail in the text, only one of which is a valid interpretation of the text, or at least is more apt than the others; or it may be the other way around; one is an incorrect choice, and the others are correct. Or a verbatim quotation may be given from the text to discover whether the reader has taken note of it and remembered it. Sometimes, in a statement either quoted directly or simply drawn from the text the reader will find a blank indicating that one or more words that will make sense of the statement have been omitted. Then follows a list of choices, lettered or numbered, among which the person being tested is asked to choose the phrase that, when inserted in the blank, best completes the statement.
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Yes, that’s 200 words explaining what multiple-choice questions are. If you’d like 426 more pages of mildly condescending prose explaining the obvious, boy, do I have a book for you. Mortimer J. Adler’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book"><em>How to Read a Book</em></a> is saved from the appellation ‘worst publication of 1940’ only due to stiff competition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Whom_God_Should_Not_Have_Created:_Persians,_Jews,_and_Flies">Ba’ath propagandists</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Here is a good chunk of the book’s actual content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main questions you must ask about any book.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the book about as a whole? […]</li>
<li>What is being said in detail, and how? […]</li>
<li>Is the book true, in whole or part? […]</li>
<li>What of it? […]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And the rules for analytical reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.</li>
<li>State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.</li>
<li>Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.</li>
<li>Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve.</li>
<li>Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.</li>
<li>Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.</li>
<li>Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.</li>
<li>Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.</li>
<li>Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”)</li>
<li>Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author is uninformed.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author is misinformed.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author is illogical.</li>
<li>Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost nothing valuable is lost in this abbreviation. The meaning of each point is simply the most obvious meaning you’d guess from the summary here and the author provides little special insight.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I’m sure Adler would wag his finger at this review for failing to follow his rules of fair criticism. But Adler also says (in his characteristically prolix way—never use one word where a dozen will do):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too often, there are things we have to read that are not really worth spending a lot of time reading; if we cannot read them quickly, it will be a terrible waste of time. It is true enough that many people read some things too slowly, and that they ought to read them faster. But many people also read some things too fast, and they ought to read those things more slowly. A good speed reading course should therefore teach you to read at many different speeds, not just one speed that is faster than anything you can manage now. It should enable you to vary your rate of reading in accordance with the nature and complexity of the material.</p>
<p>Our point is really very simple. Many books are hardly worth even skimming; some should be read quickly; and a few should be read at a rate, usually quite slow, that allows for complete comprehension. It is wasteful to read a book slowly that deserves only a fast reading; speed reading skills can help you solve that problem. But this is only one reading problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I’m mad for having <span class="noted">wasted as much time</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as I already have on this book. It does not, in my opinion, merit more serious engagement.</p>
<h1 id="postscript">Postscript</h1>
<p>If you look at Amazon reviews, there are a <em>lot</em> of five star reviews of this book. Evidently, some people have found value in it. If you’re not sure whether to believe me or the many Amazon reviewers, it may benefit you to skip directly to Appendix B (Exercises and tests at the four levels of reading). Only proceed to the body of the book if you have trouble with the exercises there.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li><div id="fn1">
<p>Perhaps I really did need to read this book if I wasn’t able to judge it a waste of time more expeditiously? No. I granted it the benefit of the doubt due to strong recommendations from people whose judgement I otherwise trust.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been talking about autocrats lately. It’d be good if we could put our new understanding to use. In that spirit, here are a couple of constructive schemes.</p>
<h1 id="retirement-plans">Retirement plans</h1>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> describe the difficulties an autocracy faces in the voluntary relinquishment of power:</p>
<blockquote>
A similar problem plagues the reverse solution, whereby the dictator agrees to a voluntary transition to democracy in return for some transfers in the future to compensate him for the lost income and privileges. Those who will benefit from a transition to democracy would be willing to make such promises, but once the dictator relinquishes his political power, there is no guarantee that citizens would agree to tax themselves in order to make payments to this former dictator. Promises of compensation to a former dictator are typically not credible.
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>
<p>If, as proposed in <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/mo-money-mo-problems-autocrat-remix/">the previous post</a>, autocrats would prefer a guarantee of somewhat reduced income to a chance of somewhat greater income, this transition would be a Pareto improvement. The autocrat gets stability and in exchange the people suffer less expropriation/taxation. So indeed, the only problem is one of commitment.</p>
<p>We can solve this problem by moving ‘up a level’. The citizens of any particular country can’t credibly commit to honoring such an agreement. But if we turn the one-shot game into an repeated game by asking an international organization (e.g. the UN) to facilitate and enforce all such agreements, we create a new equilibrium. The UN (or another international org) would have an incentive to honor these agreements because their credibility when it comes to future such agreements relies on their past behavior.</p>
<p>To be slightly more concrete: The UN creates a new program, Retirement Early Autocrat Program (it got mangled in the translation from French). Every year, REAP diplomats go around to autocracies and convene autocrats and a sortition of citizens. At the conventions, they attempt to negotiate a deal—the autocrat peacefully retires in exchange for an income of $X in perpetuity. If the deal doesn’t go through, the REAPers leave and try again next year. If the deal is struck, REAPers take care of logistics (the autocrat should probably go into comfortable exile) and ensure the agreed upon payment is collected and delivered. If either party tries to renege on the agreement, the REAPers say, “No!”, and bring some enforcement mechanism to bear. They know that if they don’t, their whole program loses credibility and purpose.</p>
<h2 id="political-feasibility">Political feasibility</h2>
<p>Their are obvious political problems here. If a country refuses to honor their agreement, REAP is put in the position of sanctioning, occupying or otherwise penalizing a country with the intent of restoring a dictator to riches. This is politically unpalatable to say the least and so credible enforcement of this side of the bargain is difficult.</p>
<p>Workarounds include requiring prepayment (i.e. the country purchases an annuity for their dictator, presumably backed by REAP) and third parties subsidizing or entirely financing the agreement. It seems plausible that such agreements would often be less than the cost of military intervention which third parties are sometimes willing to undertake.</p>
<p>For example, direct war appropriations (a dramatic underestimate of the full cost) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#Financial_cost">Iraq War</a> total $819 billion to date <span class="citation" data-cites="crawford2017">(Crawford <a href="#ref-crawford2017">2017</a>)</span>. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Sadam Hussein</a> had been expected to live to the ripe age of 96, this $819 billion would have purchased <span class="noted">an annuity paying around $56 billion a year</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In 2003, the total GDP of Iraq was around $30 billion <span class="citation" data-cites="cia2004">(CIA <a href="#ref-cia2004">2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> had been expected to live to 95, the $1.1 billion incurred by the US during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya#Costs">intervention in Libya</a> (maybe a third of the total spending by all foreign powers) would have purchased an annuity paying out a more modest $81 million per year <span class="citation" data-cites="zenko2011">(Zenko <a href="#ref-zenko2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Even this approach of third-party funding has political problems. It smacks of the dreaded Appeasement and so might be disfavored when compared to military intervention even if a bargain.</p>
<h2 id="trust-your-gut">Trust your gut</h2>
<p>Outside of political feasibility, is this scheme plausible? I admit that I don’t expect there’s a price at which each and every autocrat can be bought. There are non-pecuniary perks to power. But I also find it somewhat unlikely that <em>no</em> autocrat can be bought.</p>
<h2 id="unintended-consequences">Unintended consequences</h2>
<p>One drawback to this approach is that in addition to incentivizing abdication, it might incentivize individuals to seek autocratic power in the first place. This is a hard trade-off to escape. My only mitigation is behavioral economics and psychology seem to suggest that people underweight temporally distant and doubtful consequences when compared to immediate consequences. That means this scheme is likely more effective at encouraging abdication (the retirement plan is immediate) than encouraging the ascent to power (the retirement plan is distant and doubtful).</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related work</h2>
<p>Many others sing the praises of making safe retirement a possibility for autocrats. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
[A] hardline approach is too simplistic, and may prolong crises by discouraging autocratic leaders from leaving office lest they face prosecution. […] [P]resenting autocrats with a face-saving alternative to clinging to power might even save lives, because they would then have “less reason to be severely oppressive”. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="partridge2011">(Partridge <a href="#ref-partridge2011">2011</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dictators try to hang on until the bitter end because they love power and wealth […]. Unquestionably, though, there have been instances in which tyrants have resisted relinquishing the reins of power simply for lack of a reasonably safe haven to protect them from retaliation by those they have oppressed.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>What happens when a dictator finds it hard to leave because he has no place to go? One result is increased repression, as ever harsher steps prove necessary to crush or harass impatient local opponents.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Given the limits of diplomacy, persuasion and foreign intervention, the world community should establish a formal machinery for facilitating the voluntary retirement of dictators. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="fidell1986">(Fidell <a href="#ref-fidell1986">1986</a>)</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposal advanced here only differs in that it also proposes funding such retirements to provide a positive incentive for abdication.</p>
<h1 id="justice-and-incentives">Justice and incentives</h1>
<p>Discussions in this area like those cited above and like <span class="citation" data-cites="bosco2017">(Bosco <a href="#ref-bosco2017">2017</a>)</span> often end up talking about the perverse impact of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court">International Criminal Court</a>. In trying to ensure that autocrats are held accountable for atrocities, the ICC may actually encourage autocrats to cling to power. When in power, autocrats are relatively hard to prosecute. When out of power, they’re likely easier to prosecute.</p>
<p>A tension is then established between a deontological commitment to justice and providing autocrats with the right incentives. I think this conflict can mostly be dissolved by offering ‘credit’ for abdication. If the ICC would sentence a forcibly deposed autocrat with sentence X for their actions, that autocrat should receive sentence X - A in the case of voluntary abdication. Now, the autocrat is generally discouraged from committing atrocities and generally encouraged to abdicate. The only problem is if the credit cancels out the punishment entirely so that the autocrat gets some ‘freebie’ atrocities. The size of the credit should be carefully calibrated to account for this.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>El-Materi’s house is spacious, and directly above and along the Hammamet public beach. The compound is large and well guarded by government security. It is close to the center of Hammamet, with a view of the fort and the southern part of the town. The house was recently renovated and includes an infinity pool and a terrace of perhaps 50 meters. While the house is done in a modern style (and largely white), there are ancient artifacts everywhere: Roman columns, frescoes and even a lion’s head from which water pours into the pool. El Materi insisted the pieces are real. He hopes to move into his new (and palatial) house in Sidi Bou Said in eight to ten months.</p>
<p>The dinner included perhaps a dozen dishes, including fish, steak, turkey, octopus, fish couscous and much more. The quantity was sufficient for a very large number of guests. Before dinner a wide array of small dishes were served, along with three different juices (including Kiwi juice, not normally available here). After dinner, he served ice cream and frozen yoghurt he brought in by plane from Saint Tropez, along with blueberries and raspberries and fresh fruit and chocolate cake. (NB. El Materi and Nesrine had just returned from Saint Tropez on their private jet after two weeks vacation. El Materi was concerned about his American pilot finding a community here. The Ambassador said he would be pleased to invite the pilot to appropriate American community events.)</p>
<p>El Materi has a large tiger (“Pasha”) on his compound, living in a cage. He acquired it when it was a few weeks old. The tiger consumes four chickens a day. (Comment: The situation reminded the Ambassador of Uday Hussein’s lion cage in Baghdad.) El Materi had staff everywhere. There were at least a dozen people, including a butler from Bangladesh and a nanny from South Africa. (NB. This is extraordinarily rare in Tunisia, and very expensive.)</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Even more extravagant is their home still under construction in Sidi Bou Said. That residence, from its outward appearance, will be closer to a palace. It dominates the Sidi Bou Said skyline from some vantage points and has been the occasion of many private, critical comments. The opulence with which El Materi and Nesrine live and their behavior make clear why they and other members of Ben Ali’s family are disliked and even hated by some Tunisians. The excesses of the Ben Ali family are growing. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="godec2009">(Godec <a href="#ref-godec2009">2009</a>)</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The epigraph here describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakher_El_Materi">son-in-law</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia">Tunisia</a>’s former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali">double threat prime minister and president</a> (read: autocrat). It seems that his connection to the ruler was enough for him to lead an incomparably opulent life. I contend that this fact may actually be key to the riddle we’ve been pondering recently about autocracies.</p>
<h1 id="explaining-autocratic-underachievement">Explaining autocratic underachievement</h1>
<h2 id="recapitulating">Recapitulating</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> suggests that stratified societies are at a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. There, they suggest that autocracies underperform inclusive societies because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Autocrats cannot commit to upholding economic rights essential for growth. Realizing this, producers ‘shirk’ and growth slows.</li>
<li>Autocrats block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks improvements</a> that disadvantage them.</li>
</ol>
<p>But when we examined these explanations we found them wanting:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/autocrats-accelerate-growth-cooperation/">First</a>, we built a game theoretic model which showed that, under the right conditions, a rational dictator could credibly commit to upholding certain economic rights because it’s in their long-term interest.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/inclusive-extractive-societies-each-structural-advantages/">Second</a>, we pointed out that, even in inclusive societies, there are blocs capable of blocking Kaldor-Hicks improvements.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="an-alternative-explanation">An alternative explanation</h2>
<p>We can resuscitate the second explanation by noting how pervasive it is.</p>
<p>If you’re the dictator of basically any country, you’re so materially wealthy that more money for personal consumption is close to pointless. Tunisia (from the epigraph) is not a wealthy country. Its per capita GDP is $3,553 and its total GDP is $40 billion putting it in 96th place out of 191 listed countries <span class="citation" data-cites="weod2017">(Fund <a href="#ref-weod2017">2017</a>)</span>. Yet the president’s son-in-law has a tiger named Pasha. I’m sure you could tell a similar story about North Korea.</p>
<p>Formalizing this somewhat, I’m suggesting that basically every dictator is in the region of their utility function where the marginal utility of more money is very small indeed. If we also suppose that increasing economic growth has some expected cost (most saliently, increased risk of deposition), autocrats’ reluctance to increase growth is quite rational. In symbols and sloppily, <span class="math inline">\(u(\Delta\$ + \$) \cdot (1 - (\Delta r + r)) &lt; u(\$) \cdot (1 - r)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the risk of deposition, <span class="math inline">\(u(\$)\)</span> is the utility from money, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\$\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> are the increased money and risk associated with some proposed reform.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-evidence">Empirical evidence</h2>
<p>This is all lovely theorizing, but is it actually true? We already (briefly) <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/minor-blessings-god-emperor/#empirical-evidence">examined the data</a> on the counterclaim that restraint is useful for dictators in the long-term and the data seemed supportive. To test the new explanation offered here (diminishing marginal utility) we might look at GDP and rapacity as measured by risk of expropriation (which seems to be the standard proxy in the literature). If there is a substantial anticorrelation when comparing these variables across countries and times, our new explanation would be less plausible (i.e. Anticorrelation could indicate that autocrats in smaller countries are more rapacious because they can’t be sated by the income available from more moderate rates of expropriation). Unfortunately, the data set that’s standard for these kinds of questions <span class="citation" data-cites="prs2004">(PRS Group and others <a href="#ref-prs2004">2004</a>)</span> is proprietary.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We’ve been wondering why stratified societies grow more slowly than inclusive societies. After challenging offered explanations in previous posts, we offered a new explanation. Perhaps dictators don’t seek economic growth because increased material wealth is basically pointless for the already obscenely wealthy.</p>

<p>The input required by the calculator is a tree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML format</a>. The top level of the tree describes the different pieces of information you might find (e.g. the coin is double heads) after investigating and how likely you think each piece of information is.

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="motivating-scenario">Motivating scenario</h1>
<p>Suppose you wanted to do the absolute <em>most</em> good you could. No satisficers here. (Of course, purely hypothetical. No one in these parts would have enough hubris to undertake such a monumental task. Surely.) You wouldn’t just luck into the right activity. It would probably require careful thinking and investigating many big, difficult problems. How do you deal with moral uncertainty? <span class="citation" data-cites="macaskill2014">(MacAskill <a href="#ref-macaskill2014">2014</a>)</span> Which moral theory should you grant the most credence? What are all the possible do-gooding interventions? What are their unintended consequences?</p>
<p>If you insisted upon answering all these questions before acting, you’d almost surely die before you finished. My intuition suggests that’s not the right balance that actually optimizes impact. You should probably act in the world at some point rather than idly noodle until the reaper visits. But when? One possibility is to just pick a semi-arbitrary date on the calendar—to timebox, if you can stomach the business jargon.</p>
<p>Can you do better than this? Can you come up with a more principled way to transition from investigation to action? I contend that the answer is “Yes” and that the tool is value of information calculations.</p>
<h1 id="expected-value-of-information-calculation">Expected value of information calculation</h1>
<h2 id="simple-scenario">Simple scenario</h2>
<p>We’ll now look at a much simpler domain for expository purposes. Suppose a friend came to you and offered you a dollar if you called their coin flip correctly. As long as they didn’t charge you, it would make sense to agree as you’d expect to win 50 cents on average. Even better would be if you could swap out their coin with your own trusty <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHeadedCoin">two-headed coin</a>. Then, you could be certain that you’d make the right call and you’d get the dollar every time. The extra information you get by knowing the outcome has value.</p>
<h2 id="expected-value-of-perfect-information">Expected value of perfect information</h2>
<p>Slightly less obvious is that you can believe information is valuable to you without being certain exactly what that information is. Suppose you were unable to swap out the flipper’s coin, but a trustworthy friend came to you and whispered, “I know that the flipper uses a two-sided coin. How much will you pay me to tell you whether it’s double heads or double tails?”. After some thinking, I hope you’ll agree that you’d gain by paying up to 50 cents for this information. Without the information you expect to earn 50 cents from the flipper’s bargain. With the information, you expect to earn a dollar. If your friend tells you that it’s a two-headed coin, you can simply bet on heads. If they tell you it’s a two-tailed coin, bet on tails. Either way, you’re guaranteed the dollar. As long as you can react accordingly via your bet, you should be willing to pay for this unknown information. Paying, for example, 20 cents would still leave you ahead because your net gain from the whole transaction would be 80 cents.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="expected-value-of-imperfect-information">Expected value of imperfect information</h2>
<p>“But I can’t believe my susurrous friend unreservedly and still hold my head high at the local fallibilist’s meetings!”, you object. Right you are. Even if your friend’s whispers don’t leave you 100% certain about what kind of coin the flipper has, we can still apply the same logic from before. The arithmetic is just a bit more complicated. Ultimately, the conclusion that reducing our uncertainty can have value—even without knowing in which direction the uncertainty will be reduced—remains intact.</p>
<h2 id="other-explanations">Other explanations</h2>
<p>If you’d like an alternative exposition with more details and some accompanying graphics, I think these are both pretty good: <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~kirkwood/DAStuff/decisiontrees/DecisionTreePrimer-3.pdf">The Value of Information</a>, <a href="http://treeplan.com/chapters/value-of-information-in-decision-trees.pdf">Value of Information in Decision Trees</a>.</p>
<h1 id="calculator">Calculator</h1>
<p>But you might not need to understand the details of the calculation laid out in those links because I provide a handy dandy value of information calculator for you here.</p>
<p>The input required by the calculator is a tree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML format</a>. The top level of the tree describes the different pieces of information you might find (e.g. the coin is double heads) after investigating and how likely you think each piece of information is. Each of these info nodes has children corresponding to actions you might take (e.g. bet heads). The final level of the tree (the children of the action nodes) describe the outcomes that actually occur and their probability of occurrence given the information received.</p>
<p>So the default tree entered below describes the coin flip scenario described above when you have no clue as to which two-sided coin is in use and you believe your susurrous friend is absolutely reliable.</p>
<p>In addition to showing the expected value of information, the calculator shows the corresponding simplified scenario in which you have no way of gaining information about outcomes at the bottom. For example, it shows you the original coin flip scenario before your susurrous friend comes along. This is offered simply as a point of comparison.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2013">(Acemoglu and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2013">2013</a>)</span> (and surely elsewhere), Acemoglu and Robinson contend that inclusive societies have inherent economic advantages over stratified (extractive) societies. If true, this is quite important; it suggests that, in the long run, we should <span class="noted">expect inclusive societies to “win” out</span>[^inclusive-win]. The moral arc of the universe bends toward justice and all that.</p>
<h1 id="oligarchs-favor-stability-over-growth">Oligarchs favor stability over growth</h1>
<p>But is it true? As far as I can tell, the best articulation of this claim is in section 6 of <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>. It lays out several claims in support of the argument that oligarchic societies have a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/autocrats-accelerate-growth-cooperation/">Last time</a>, we examined their first claim and found it wanting. In this post, we’ll focus on the second:</p>
<blockquote>
Another related source of inefficient economic institutions arises from the desire of political elites to protect their political power. [..] [T]he political elite should evaluate every potential economic change not only according to its economic consequences, such as its effects on economic growth and income distribution, but also according to its political consequences. […] Fearing these potential threats to their political power, the elites may oppose changes in economic institutions that would stimulate economic growth.
</blockquote>
<p>I have no problems with this claim in itself.</p>
<h1 id="invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies-again">Invidious majoritarian tyrannies, again</h1>
<p>But I think it tells an incomplete story. It’s not the case that social efficiency can only be impeded by minorities in oligarchic societies. Societies with inclusive institutions can also user their decision-making process to block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks improvements</a>. If a majority weakly prefers A to B while a minority strongly prefers B to A, majority voting will choose A even though this doesn’t necessarily maximize social welfare. This is precisely the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/innocuous-invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies">invidious tyranny of the majority we talked about before</a>. An oligarchic society could well avoid this problem.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="collective-action-problems">Collective action problems</h1>
<p>I think it’s fair to gloss Acemoglu and Robinson’s ‘inclusive’ and ‘extractive’ as societies with, respectively, many agents and few agents when it comes to making important political decisions. In this case, we should expect inclusive societies to have more numerous and more serious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">problems of collective action</a>. At the most extreme—autocracy, there can be no coordination problems at the highest levels of power.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Of course, these counterarguments also aren’t definitive. For example, taking advantage of the structural benefits of oligarchy requires fairly sophisticated oligarchs.</p>
<p>But these considerations do change the overall picture. Instead of saying that stratified societies are at a pure disadvantage to inclusive societies and inclusive societies are thus destined to win out, we see that each has structure has advantages and disadvantages. It comes down to an empirical question about which set of advantages is more important in practice.</p>

    <title>Preference utilitarianism—psychological or metaphysical? III</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Earlier, I <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">suggested that there are multiple interpretations of preference utilitarianism available</a>, and <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">outlined the implications of a few</a>. Now, we’ll clarify how this whole line of thinking relates to existing discussion because context is good.</p>
<h1 id="value-based-on-preferences"><em>Value based on preferences</em></h1>
<p>At first, I thought this paper might be detailing exactly the same thing I have here. However, further reading leads me to believe that they’re addressing something more like a secular version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma">Euthyphro dilemma</a>. Do we prefer good things because they are good? Or are good things good because they’re preferred? This issue is distinct from the one we’ve examined here.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="misguided-preferences">Misguided preferences</h1>
<p>Some object to preference utilitarianism because preferences can be “misinformed, crazy, horrendous, or trivial” <span class="citation" data-cites="sep-consequentialism">(Sinnott-Armstrong <a href="#ref-sep-consequentialism">2015</a>)</span>. This objection and its responses also deal with an error (loosely conceived) in the overall scheme of preference utilitarianism. But the error here is in the preference itself which is distinct from the preferrer’s beliefs about the world. To see that these are indeed distinct: Imagine someone with complete and total amnesia. They may well prefer certain states of the world to others but have no beliefs about the world at all because of their (philosophically convenient) thoroughgoing amnesia.</p>
<h1 id="nozicks-experience-machine">Nozick’s experience machine</h1>
<p>Nozick’s experience machine is the most similar to our line of thinking here <span class="citation" data-cites="nozick2013">(Nozick <a href="#ref-nozick2013">2013</a>)</span>. It also examines a case where our beliefs about the world diverge from the fact of the matter. However, Nozick mostly uses the rhetorical device to argue that PPU (in our terminology) is an impoverished notion of the good. Virtues matter, rights matter, etc. We’ve instead examined MPU as an answer to the problem posed by the experience machine and looked at the whole issue in more detail. In other words, Nozick suggests the problem might be fixed by considering more than just preferences when determining the good and I’ve suggested the problem might be fixed by adjusting when we regard a preference as fulfilled.</p>

    <title>Preference utilitarianism—psychological or metaphysical? II</title>
    <link href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-ii/" />
    <id>https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-ii/</id>
    <published>2018-06-05T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2018-06-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">Last time</a> we highlighted that there are actual several possible interpretations of preference utilitarianism. These depend on when you get to a recognize a preference as having been satisfied in your moral accounting: When the world changes to accord with your preference? When you believe the world to have changed? When you have a justified true belief that the world has changed?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll draw out some implications of these views which will also serve as preliminary arguments for and against. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on the two poles: preferences are satisfied when the preferrer believes the world to have changed (purely psychological), and preferences are satisfied when the world has changed (purely metaphysical).</p>
<p>(I’ll also note that I assume advocates of preference utilitarianism implicitly (or explicitly and silently?) believe the psychological variant and my intuition favors it. If I argue against that position more vehemently, it’s only a sign of esteem.)</p>
<h1 id="psychological">Psychological</h1>
<h2 id="deception">Deception</h2>
<p>One obvious but unfortunate implication of the psychological point of view is that self-deception is A-OK. Obligatory even. If I’d like to be create a grand unified theory of physics, I may find it easier to set myself a bastardized version of the problem than to solve the real thing. And if I can deceive myself in this way, the psychological theory of preference utilitarianism (henceforth PPU) makes a prima facie case that I am morally obliged to. (Because this deceptive approach is easier, it means I can satisfy this preference quickly and move on the satisfaction of other preferences rather than sinking vast gobs of time into the ‘authentic’ method.)</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But it’s not just self-deception. It’s any and all deception. Suppose I want to be loved by my family. If I’m a bit of git, my family might judge that just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gaslighting</a> me into believing I already am is easier and more likely to succeed than going through the hard personal and interpersonal work of improvement. Again, they may even be morally obliged to gaslight me. Similarly, depending on circumstances, a polity might be morally obliged to wage an effective propaganda campaign denying the presence of poverty rather than actually solving it. We’ve reached peak Orwell already.</p>
<p><!-- One response is that people might have second-order preferences that their preferences are *actually* satisfied---that is, that the world is in accord with their preferences. But this is little help for PPU; it only moves the problem one level up. Now, in addition to an incentive to self-deceive, I have an incentive to choose a lax episteme. If I pick an episteme with low standards of evidence,  --> <!-- I will believe that this second-order preference is satisfied precisely when I believe that the first-order preference is satisfied. I will never simultaneously believe that the world is in state S in accordance with my first-order preference, but believe that my second-order preference has been frustrated because I merely falsely believe state S obtains. --></p>
<p>One reasonable response is that these deceptions are short-sighted. Satisfying these ‘gateway’ preferences might unlock new and better possibilities that are unavailable to the deceived. An actual grand unified theory of physics might allow things heretofore considered impossible.</p>
<p>But not all preferences are like this. Some are truly terminal. No further beliefs or actions are contingent upon their fulfillment in the world and so there is nothing that pragmatically militates for their accuracy. Being loved might be like this. I struggle to think of any further beliefs or actions that are only available to the truly loved and unavailable to those who are surrounded by committed gaslighters.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d rest uneasy if my only defense against being morally obliged to deceive was that it was sometimes pragmatically unwise. If a thing seems bad, it’s nice to have a principled way of avoiding it rather than hoping that contingent fact works in our favor.</p>
<h2 id="supervenience-lost">Supervenience lost</h2>
<p>At the end of the hazing, Broseph’s frat brother came back into the room and gave the CCTV a good ol’ Fonze thump. The colors shifted back and reflected the fact of the matter. “Bro, We got you <em>good</em>!. The TV had distorted colors. The M&amp;Ms actually started out mixed and he was sorting them into separate piles for each color. Psych!”</p>
<p>With Broseph’s new beliefs about what happened, his evaluation of the morality of the original M&amp;M shuffling has flipped. Furthermore, if you’d asked Broseph about returning the M&amp;Ms to their original position before the revelation, he’d have correctly said it was good (he believed it satisfied his preferences). Just after the revelation, he would also be correct in claiming that it was bad (he believed it frustrated his preferences). So under PPU, a single action can correctly be said to both right and wrong. That’s worrying because <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience-ethics/">supervenience</a> isn’t something to give up lightly.</p>
<p>The only way to retain supervenience is to contextualize each action in light of observers’ beliefs. For example, “Returning the M&amp;Ms to their original position is good <em>when</em> Broseph believes the CCTV and thus believes all the M&amp;Ms are the same color.” and “Returning to the M&amp;Ms to their original position is good <em>when</em> Broseph doubts the CCTV and thus believes all the resulting piles are different colors.”</p>
<p>This works, but it’s contrary to the plain language used when people make moral evaluations. If we want PPU and supervenience, we must interpret statements like “Action A is right.” as having a silent contextualizer: “I believe action A in the context of belief B is right.” This is a bit weird.</p>
<h2 id="anthropic-effects">Anthropic effects</h2>
<p>PPU also seems to imply that surprise, secret murders aren’t wrong. Even though we imagine most people have a preference for life, if they’re dead, there is no preferrer that’s frustrated. But this issue applies to any embodied ethic including, for example, hedonic utilitarianism so we won’t belabor it here.</p>
<h1 id="metaphysical">Metaphysical</h1>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>One benefit of PPU is that it ‘screens out’ the vast majority of preferrers. The preferences an actor must account for are precisely those of agents that will come to know about the action. On the other hand, metaphysical preference utilitarianism (henceforth MPU) commits us to caring about <em>all</em> preferences.</p>
<p>Suppose the frat brothers had cut the CCTV cable so Broseph was just sitting in an empty room staring at a blank TV. MPU implies the masked brother is still morally obliged to sort the M&amp;Ms—it brings the world into accord with Broseph’s preferences which is good even if Broseph doesn’t know about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are potentially many other humans on Earth with preferences about M&amp;M sorting. The masked brother ought to try to satisfy these as well. Satisfying these preferences with almost no information is quixotic, but I’ve typically found a “Just do your best!” reply to concerns about tractability issues in utilitarianism pretty satisfying.</p>
<p>Even stranger is the possibility that the masked brother might be obliged to account for preferences outside of his light cone. If an alien that cares about M&amp;M sorting lives on the edge of the universe such that the alien is outside of our light cone (i.e. we can never have any causal influence on it), the most obvious versions of MPU suggest that the masked brother should still account for these preferences.</p>
<p>And once you’ve opened the door to honoring preferrers who are causally isolated from the actor, it seems that you ought to honor the preferences of both past (i.e. the deceased) and future (i.e. the unborn) preferrers. This is both weird and a bit convenient because it provides a way to talk about <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-intergenerational/">intergenerational justice</a>.</p>
<h3 id="path-dependence">Path dependence</h3>
<p>If we accept the implication that past preferences have moral import for current actions, we’ve introduced path dependence. The same action can be correctly subject to different moral evaluations depending on past preferences. For example, if we’re in time 2 and indifferent between actions A and B, but someone in time 1 preferred action A, we ought to do A. On the other hand, if the person in time 1 preferred action B, we ought to do that. So our moral obligations in time 2 differ even if the preferrer in time 1 is now deceased and these two counterfactual worlds are identical at time 2. We’ve lost supervenience again.</p>
<h3 id="mistaken-preferences">Mistaken preferences</h3>
<p>Another bizarre consequence of honoring past preferences is that we might be obliged to honor our own past preferences that we now regard as mistaken. If our preferences are time-weighted (i.e. the longer a preference is held, the more weight it’s granted in our moral calculus), naive MPU suggests I’m morally obliged to honor an old, long-standing preference contrary to my current preferences until I’ve held the current preference long enough. That is, if I preferred action A to B for times 1-10, and start preferring action B at time 11, it is only morally permissible to undertake B from time 21 on.</p>
<h3 id="subconclusion">Subconclusion</h3>
<p>These concerns all suggest that we must be more selective in which preferences we regard as morally important—all preferences everywhere and everywhen quickly becomes baffling. It’s not enough to say that a preference is satisfied when the world comes into accord with it. There must be some further relationship between the preference and the world. But what is this demarcation criterion that doesn’t rely on psychology? Light cones?</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We’ve examined two possible interpretations of preference utilitarianism: psychological preference utilitarianism (the morally important part of preference satisfaction is when the preferrer believes it to be satisfied) and metaphysical preference utilitarianism (the morally important part of preference satisfaction is when the world comes into accord with the preference). Each has strange implications. PPU favors deception and gives up intuitive supervenience. MPU requires us to pick us some alternative, non-obvious demarcation criterion; the broadest possible demarcation criterion is a bad candidate.</p>
<p>Maybe the best solution is knowledge preference utilitarianism? Rather than the preferrer’s belief being the crucial ingredient, it’s knowledge—justified true belief.</p>]]></summary>

If a preference is satisfied in a forest and no one is around to witness it, is it good?
</blockquote>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Preference utilitarianism holds that the good a utilitarian ought to maximize is the satisfaction of preferences. Preferences exist in our mind, but (often) refer to the external world. Thus, the satisfaction of preferences must bridge this gap between the mind and the world. That is, if I have a preference for the world to be in a particular state which was once unsatisfied and that very preference is now satisfied, it must be because my beliefs about the world have changed. But beliefs about the world are the domain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a>. Preferences may then be the Trojan horse that smuggle the problems of epistemology into the already troubled camp of ethics.</p>
<h1 id="color-shifted-cctv">Color shifted CCTV</h1>
<p>Let’s try to make the issue a bit more vivid.</p>
<div class="skippable">
<p>Suppose, in his halcyon days, Broseph Raz attended The School for Convenient Philosophical Thought Experiments. At the school, they inculcated in him the sincere preference that M&amp;M’s must always be sorted by color. One group for blues, one for green, etc. During his sophomore year there, he pledged at the premier philosophical Greek fraternity on campus, ΣΟΦ. As part of the pledge process, he had to take part in their fiendishly thought-provoking hazing rituals:</p>
<!--more-->
<p>His frat brother lifted the blindfold, galumphed out of the room, and locked the door. All Broseph saw in the dusty room was a small CRT TV looking onto a table covered in green M&amp;Ms. Broseph hadn’t really understood the school’s M&amp;M obsession when he’d first matriculated, but he now had to admit it was pretty satisfying. Soon enough, his reveries were interrupted. A man in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gettier">Edmund Gettier</a> mask entered the frame and hovered a grubby hand over the pile. He turned to the camera and growled, “Don’t look away!”. Then he started splitting the pile M by M. One to the left, one to the right. One to the left, one to the right. Broseph gritted his teeth. But he looked on; he wouldn’t let his brothers down. The masked man continued. By now, more M&amp;Ms had been pushed out of the pile than were left behind; it would be over soon. Then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The masked man hadn’t even finished splitting the pile! There were three separate piles of green M&amp;Ms now. Broseph groaned as the masked man cackled and ducked out of the frame.</p>
<p>As the masked man left the Chamber of Trials, he pulled off his mask and was met with raucous guffaws. “Bro! That was rad.” High fives all around. “Dude, you killed it. Broseph had no idea.” “Browen, that was sick. You just took one good look at that mixed pile of M&amp;Ms and started sorting them. Reds with reds, greens with greens, blues with blues. No hesitation! But they all looked blue to Broseph! You should have seen his face. I was crying laughing, bro!”</p>
</div>
<h2 id="no-nonsense">No-nonsense</h2>
<p>Suppose someone prefers M&amp;Ms to be sorted by color. Now suppose they have a CCTV view onto a room with what appears to be a pile of green M&amp;Ms. The trick is that the CCTV shifts colors so they <em>all</em> appear to be green. The actual fact of the matter is that the pile is a riot of colors. Someone else comes into the room and sorts the M&amp;Ms by color. The fact of the matter is that the M&amp;Ms have gone from mixed to sorted (satisfying the spectator’s preferences), but the spectator perceives them to have gone from sorted to arbitrarily separated (frustrating the spectator’s preferences). Is what just happened good or bad?</p>
<h1 id="epistemology-in-your-ethics">Epistemology in your ethics</h1>
<p>The core problem then is this: I have preferences over states of the world. What part of satisfying those preferences does preference utilitarianism rate as morally important? Is the moral good obtained when the world changes or when I learn about the change in the world? And if it’s not about the world itself but about my state of mind, what precisely is morally important? Is it my beliefs, my true beliefs, my justified true beliefs?</p>
<p>To use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map and territory metaphor</a>: If I’d prefer the world to be otherwise, which is the important part? Are my preferences satisfied as far as preference utilitarianism is concerned when the territory changes? When the map changes? When both have changed? When both have changed and the change in the map was justified by the change in the territory?</p>]]></summary>

Certainly fiction-as-ideological vessel carries dangers.

<p>GDP and derived metrics (e.g., productivity) have been central to understanding economic progress and well-being. In principle, the change in consumer surplus (compensating expenditure) provides a superior, and more direct, measure of the change in well-being, especially for digital goods, but in practice, it has been difficult to measure. We explore the potential of massive online choice experiments to measure consumers’ willingness to accept compensation for losing access to various digital goods and thereby estimate the consumer surplus generated from these goods. We test the robustness of the approach and benchmark it against established methods, including incentive compatible choice experiments that require participants to give up Facebook for a certain period in exchange for compensation. The proposed choice experiments show convergent validity and are massively scalable. Our results indicate that <strong>digital goods have created large gains in well-being that are missed by conventional measures of GDP and productivity</strong>. By periodically querying a large, representative sample of goods and services, including those which are not priced in existing markets, changes in consumer surplus and other new measures of well-being derived from these online choice experiments have the potential for providing cost-effective supplements to existing national income and product accounts.</p>

    <title>In praise of principal-agent problems</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-concept">The concept</h1>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal–agent problems</a> occur when a principal enlists an agent to act on their behalf, but the agent has private information and independent interests. This scenario means that the principal incurs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost">agency costs</a> when compared to simply acting themselves.</p>
<p>Examples include brokers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running">front running</a>, doctors <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-who-take-company-cash-tend-to-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs">prescribing medications based on their relationships with pharmaceutical companies</a>, and <a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/taxi-meter3.htm">taxis taking overlong routes</a>.</p>
<h1 id="principal-agent-possibilities">Principal-agent possibilities</h1>
<p>As these examples suggest, principal–agent problems are (I think) usually viewed as a bad thing. And they often are. But they can also be a refuge. To see this, we just have to flip our sympathies. The common examples encourage us to sympathize with the principal and see the agent as abusing their power.</p>
<p>Examples from the flipped perspective include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Micromanager</dt>
<dd>If your manager at work is a petty tyrant, you surely appreciate and exploit whatever gaps in their knowledge you can find to work in ways you believe more effective or just to preserve your psychological health.
</dd>
<dt>Overbearing parents</dt>
<dd>Some parents seem to think of their children as agents in the project of aggrandizing themselves. Children in this situation may justly find that moving out–an increase in agency costs—represents a gift.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The common theme here is that the principals are people of power misusing it and their ignorances open up little pockets of possibility for the less powerful.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-like-a-state"><em>Seeing like a state</em></h2>
<p>We can put this perspective to more grandiose ends. For example, we can view the story of <span class="citation" data-cites="scott1998">(Scott <a href="#ref-scott1998">1998</a>)</span> as the story of high modernists trying to reduce agency costs. In weak, early states, elite principals had limited capacity to bend the populace (agents) to their will. There simply wasn’t enough information for elites to make any but the most basic demands. It’s hard to conscript or tax citizens when you don’t know their names or even how many there are. From this principal–agent perspective, the celebrated ‘metis’ (local knowledge) is precisely the information asymmetry that justifies granting agents (some) freedom of action.</p>
<p>In other words, metis means that elite principals should delegate to agents because they don’t know everything. Principals respond to this fact by either trying to limit metis (to reduce agency costs) and make the people legible or by ignoring metis—to sometimes disastrous effect.</p>
<h2 id="why-nations-fail"><em>Why nations fail</em></h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> talks about problems that arise in stratified societies due to <a href="http://www.econport.org/content/teaching/modules/NFG/Commit.html">commitment problems</a>. I think we can also think of principal–agent problems as constraining autocracies (and other stratified, non-inclusive societies). A society in which there were no information asymmetries between autocrat and citizens would be the most perfect totalitarianism. Fortunately, no autocrat has yet achieved this and so autocrats must rely on other agents. These agents are assigned tasks with some latitude because the autocrat doesn’t know exactly how a task should be performed and task performance is evaluated with some latitude because the autocrat can’t know precisely how a task was executed. These twin latitudes create room for subversion or otherwise allow independent human expression rather than providing the autocrat with a nation of perfect puppets.</p>
<p>Just like in <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>, we can use this structural feature of stratified societies to explain the benefits of inclusive institutions. Principal–agent relationships will always be limited and brittle because the principal can only specify finite requirements. The success we see in principal–agent relationships often relies on some good faith on the part of the agent. But autocracies should often expect the principal–agent relationship to be adversarial. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule">Under these conditions, contracts and explicit requirements are often woefully inadequate.</a> On the other hand, inclusive institutions give everybody an independent stake in success—thereby converting agents into fellow principals and providing robust incentive alignment.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll note that as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance">mass surveillance</a> improves, this advantage for inclusivity weakens. As mentioned previously, principal–agent problems only exist in the face of information asymmetries. To the extent that surveillance gives principals more information about agents and their actions, agency costs are reduced and autocracies become more effective. I’m certainly not the first to point out how mass surveillance can enable further domination, but I think this is a somewhat interesting angle on that observation.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2013">(Acemoglu and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2013">2013</a>)</span> (and surely elsewhere), Acemoglu and Robinson contend that inclusive societies have inherent economic advantages over stratified societies. If true, this is quite important; it suggests that, in the long run, we should <span class="noted">expect inclusive societies to “win” out</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The moral arc of the universe bends toward justice and all that.</p>
<h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>
<p>But is it true? As far as I can tell, the best articulation of this claim is in section 6 of <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>. It lays out several claims in support of the argument that oligarchic societies have a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. In this post, we’ll focus on the first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a situation in which an individual or a group holds unconstrained political power. Also suppose that productive investments can be undertaken by a group of citizens or producers that are distinct from the “political elites”, i.e., the current power holders. The producers will only undertake the productive investments if they expect to receive the benefits from their investments. Therefore, a set of economic institutions protecting their property rights are necessary for investment. Can the society opt for a set of economic institutions ensuring such secure property rights? The answer is often no (even assuming that “society” wants to do so).</p>
<p>The problem is that the political elites—those in control of political power—cannot commit to respect the property rights of the producers once the investment are undertaken. Naturally, ex ante, before investments are undertaken, they would like to promise secure property rights. But the fact that the monopoly of political power in their hands implies that they cannot commit to not hold-up producers once the investments are sunk.</p>
<p>[…] The consequence is clear: without such protection, productive investments are not undertaken, and opportunities for economic growth go unexploited.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="counterclaim">Counterclaim</h1>
<p>Contrary to the claim here, I think a rational and informed autocrat could credibly support economic institutions like property rights. If the autocrat and the producers interact over a non-trivial period of time, producers can condition their behavior on the autocrat’s. That is, the producers can decide that they’ll only invest if the autocrat preserves economic freedoms. If the autocrat expropriates and otherwise abuses the producers, they’ll do the bare minimum (shirk). Knowing this, the autocrat realizes that they can’t simply choose to loot while the producers continue to invest. The autocrat’s choice is between looting a minimal economy and a more restrained taxation of a growing economy. Under the right circumstances, a rational autocrat would do best to choose taxing a growing economy rather than looting a minimal economy.</p>
<h1 id="model">Model</h1>
<h2 id="single-shot">Single-shot</h2>
<p>Let’s model this situation more explicitly to make our claims precise. We can describe it as a two player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game</a>. Player one is the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> and player two is the <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. During the game, the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> must decide to either <span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\)</span> at a sustainable rate or <span class="math inline">\(\text{Loot}\)</span> by taxing at an onerous rate, expropriating and otherwise taking a larger share of the economic output. We represent these actions as fractions of economic output taken by the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(1 \geq l &gt; k \geq 0\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> must decide to <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Shirk}\)</span>—just get by with a minimum amount of work at a subsistence standard of living—or <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Invest}\)</span>—devote more effort to production in the hopes of future improvements to productivity. The extra cost that producers pay when <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investing}\)</span> is represented by <span class="math inline">\(c &gt; 0\)</span>. In either case, <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> receive whatever fraction of the economic output the dictator doesn’t take—<span class="math inline">\(1 - k\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1 - l\)</span>. This is all described more succinctly in the table below:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Single-shot game of economic production in an autocratic regime</p>
</figcaption>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat} \backslash \mathtt{Producers}\)</span></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\)</span></td>

<tr class="even">

<td><span class="math inline">\(l \backslash \mathtt{1 - l}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>In this game, Acemoglu’s and Robinson’s claim is correct. <span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\backslash\mathtt{Invest}\)</span> is not an equilibrium. The <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrat}\)</span> can always improve their outcome by switching from a strategy of <span class="math inline">\(\text{Tax}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\text{Loot}\)</span>. Similarly, without any opportunity to recoup the increased cost of <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investing}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> will always prefer <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Shirking}\)</span>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="iterated">Iterated</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>But this isn’t a good model of the situation. <span class="math inline">\(\text{Autocrats}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Producers}\)</span> interact repeatedly over a sustained period of time. We have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game">repeated game</a>. Because no one knows when an autocrats reign will end, we avoid a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game#Finitely_repeated_games">finitely repeated game</a> and model this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game#Infinitely_repeated_games">infinitely repeated game</a> with a discount rate <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> or, less pessimistically, as a game with some fixed probability of continuing after each stage <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now that the game has a sequence of stages, we can meaningfully incorporate the impact of <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investing}\)</span>. The basic intuition is that there is some growth rate <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\delta} &gt; r \geq 1\)</span></span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> and each instance of <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{Investment}\)</span> compounds it. More formally, the productivity produced by actions up through time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p(\mathbf{a^t}) = r^{\sum_{t=0}^t \mathtt{I}(a_{\mathtt{R}}^t)}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is an indicator function defined as <img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/8714069561825009905.svg" title="
\mathtt{I}(a_{\mathtt{R}}^t) = \begin{cases}
  1 &amp; a_{\mathtt{R}}^t = \mathtt{Invest} \\
  0 &amp; a_{\mathtt{R}}^t = \mathtt{Shirk} \\
\end{cases}

<p>We just use this productivity multiplicatively with our previous terms so the new stage game looks like:</p>

<p>Let’s check our math and make this a bit more concrete by plugging in some numbers.

We’ll pick <span class="math inline">\(r = 1.04\)</span>. Now plugging in all our parameters, we can calculate all the payoffs. We end up with a game like this:</p>

<p>Happily, this supports our earlier claim that, with the right choice of parameters and strategy space, cooperation is an equilibrium.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Contra <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>, autocrats can credibly cooperate in support of economic institutions which promote growth. The possibility for cooperation arises when we move from a single-shot game to a repeated game (as is often the case). This is bad news because it means we have one fewer reason to suppose that economics supports inclusivity in the long run.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="life-extension-in-autocrats">Life extension in autocrats</h1>
<p>In a <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bryan-caplan-case-for-and-against-education/">recent episode of the 80,000 hours podcast</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html">Bryan Caplan</a> briefly talked about totalitarianism. During that section of the conversation, he dropped this tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
[F]un fact is Stalin actually had a life-extension program dedicated to try to make himself immortal. It didn’t work, but my view that is if it worked, than I think the Soviet Union would still be ruled by Joseph Stalin.
</blockquote>
<h1 id="incentive-alignment">Incentive alignment</h1>
<p>Infinite tyrants sound worse than finite tyrants. But there’s a silver lining: Long tenure in autocrats discourages rapacity.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>For the theoretical argument, we turn to <span class="citation" data-cites="olson1993">(Olson <a href="#ref-olson1993">1993</a>)</span>. First, we suppose an autocrat is a rational, economically informed actor trying to maximize their total consumption over their lifetime. Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that an economy will generate its maximum income only if there is a high rate of investment and that much of the return on long-term investments is received long after the investment is made. This means that an autocrat who is taking a long view will try to convince his subjects that their assets will be permanently protected not only from theft by others but also from expropriation by the autocrat himself. If his subjects fear expropriation, they will invest less, and in the long run his tax collections will be reduced.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Now suppose that an autocrat is only concerned about getting through the next year. He will then gain by expropriating any convenient capital asset whose tax yield over the year is less than its total value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond limiting expropriation, an immortal autocrat would want to support other economic freedoms that increase long-run growth—as long as they encourage growth more than they imperil the autocrat. Other things in this category might include: the impartial enforcement of contracts and a stable currency.</p>
<p>Recapitulating, an autocrat that orients toward the long run gets to consume more in the long run—as long as they stay in power. All else equal, an immortal autocrat will stay in power longer than a merely mortal autocrat and thus has more incentive to focus on the long run. The good news is that everyone else also gets to consume more and enjoy more economic freedoms along the way.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="empirical-evidence">Empirical evidence</h2>
<p>If this model actually described reality, what might we observe? One thing we’d expect to see is that precarious autocrats expropriate more (to the extent they recognize their own precarity). And, indeed, we do see this.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="azzimonti2018">(Azzimonti <a href="#ref-azzimonti2018">2018</a>)</span> uses panel data on 145 countries from 1984–2014 and (among other things) looks at <span class="noted">government stability</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as determined by a panel of experts and risk of expropriation as determined by a panel of experts. It finds “a strong negative correlation between government stability and the risk of expropriation across regions. This indicates that countries where political turnover is high are more likely to engage in expropriation activities.”</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/moral-limits-markets-summary/">Last time</a>, I summarized Michael Sandel’s <em>What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="sandel2012">(Sandel <a href="#ref-sandel2012">2012</a>)</span>. Now, I’ll say my own things instead of regurgitating Sandel (as delicious as premasticated Sandel may be).</p>
<p>Throughout, I’ll try to resist temptation and keep the discussion to the <em>moral</em> failings of markets. There’s a whole vast literature on how and when markets fail on their own terms (i.e. don’t achieve social efficiency) that I’d like to avoid.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve tried to order things for comprehensibility, but there isn’t a single, coherent thesis here. Most of the sections are standalone.</p>
<h1 id="markets-defined">Markets defined</h1>
<p>I think it behooves us to start with a discussion of precisely what markets are. This should clarify and it should help us understand which features of markets are necessary and which contingent.</p>
<p>Without thinking <em>too</em> deeply about it, I’ll say a market is a legal and sociocultural system via which unaffiliated parties may exchange rights—paradigmatically, one party gives up the rights for exclusive use (i.e. property rights) of some tangible good and receives in exchange the rights for exclusive use of some quantity of money. I choose this annoyingly abstract definition to highlight the flexibility and generality of markets which is important when talking about atypical markets.</p>
<h1 id="markets-vs.property">Markets vs. property</h1>
<p>This definition quickly suggests the importance of distinguishing between markets (the mechanism of exchange) and property (what’s exchanged on the market). Property (or some other bundle of rights) is a precondition to markets. Unfortunately, I think the book rather wholly <span class="noted">elides this distinction</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Many of the ills attributed to atypical markets are more accurately pinned on property. In fact, I can’t think of any examples where ‘propertizing’ (i.e. formalizing and legislating the rights to some formerly fuzzy thing) is okay and market exchange is <span class="noted">squicky</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. If the market in slaves had been abolished and ownership of slaves could be transferred only by inheritance, chattel slavery would have been no less appalling.</p>
<p>This isn’t pure, idle pedantry. By omitting markets from the story, we highlight that core to the corruption concern is people relinquishing capacities we’d rather they keep. From this perspective, the problem with women agreeing to be sterilized for cash is that they’re relinquishing their reproductive rights while we think they ought to be inalienable; it invites outsiders in to our bodies. “Bank One blast” rankles because our choice of words ought to be our own; to do otherwise is to invite outsiders in to our minds.</p>
<p>We’re then left with the question: Is it best to deny people the capacity to relinquish certain capacities? Morally? Politically?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="inequality-vs.markets">Inequality vs. markets</h1>
<p>Another distinction which gets less attention than I’d like is between markets themselves and markets under conditions of inequality.</p>
<p>The glib (and yet obligatory) response here is to point to the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics: “out of all possible Pareto optimal outcomes, one can achieve any particular one by enacting a lump-sum wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over.” In other words, this just confirms that markets would achieve fairer outcomes under fairer circumstances.</p>
<p>But I don’t have a wand I can wave to eliminate inequality and I don’t expect to come across one any time soon. So I’ll try to engage with the argument more seriously.</p>
<p>Here’s my best counterargument to markets and inequality then. I think we can tell a story (by which I mean this is very speculative) where the growing reach of markets is a consequence rather than a cause of inequality. In this story, <span class="noted">powerful actors encourage the marketization of all things</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> because they expect to be able to better leverage their power on the market. When there’s a market in organs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">Mr. Burns</a> can buy all the spare organs he needs, no muss, no fuss. Without a market, he’d have to pursue a less savory route. If we believe this story, the retrenchment of markets might only lead the powerful to find some other mechanism to exercise their power.</p>
<p>All that said, I do more or less grant this argument. We live in a world of radical inequality and, in many circumstances, markets magnify that inequality.</p>
<h1 id="crowding-out-and-expressive-actions">Crowding out and expressive actions</h1>
<p>On multiple occasions, Sandel talks about market norms crowding out other norms. If we examine why this happens, I think we’ll find something useful.</p>
<p>Once we leave the most naive versions of rational choice, we can suggest that humans sometimes act for expressive reasons. That is, we intend to or happen to communicate with our actions. When I show up late to pick up my child, I express that I don’t value the time of the day-care workers. Conversely, punctuality expresses that I do. When I agree to accept nuclear waste in my town, I am communicating that I value my fellow citizens and that I am sensitive to claims of civic need.</p>
<p>On this view, market norms can crowd out other norms because they make it harder to express what people hope to express. Prompt pick up might express respect or it might express unwillingness to pay. Agreeing to house nuclear waste might express civic responsibility or it might just be a cash grab. If people are going to misinterpret an action, it’s a much less appealing expression.</p>
<p>If we accept this story, crowding out isn’t unique to the introduction of market incentives. <em>Any</em> additional incentives muddy the expressive waters. Because observers only see the action and not the intention, they’re left to guess which predominated.</p>
<h1 id="preferences-are-malleable">Preferences are malleable</h1>
<p>Markets as ‘corrupting’ is largely contingent. It depends on the meaning we assign to markets which is socioculturally determined. We can imagine some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Randian</a> paradise in which markets are held in the highest esteem. Here, allocating a thing via the market elevates rather than degrades.</p>
<p>Even short of some mass reeducation program that shifts the whole culture, I think this is relevant. I and many economists object to the use of markets much less than average, it seems. This suggests that at least some individuals can independently make peace with atypical markets. If the meaning assigned to markets changed enough for enough people, markets might be both more efficient and non-corrupting.</p>
<p>However, because markets are fundamentally an impersonal mechanism for the allocation of goods, that meaning is unavoidable. Actions intended to be personal and particularistic ought not to be conducted via the market.</p>
<h1 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h1>
<p>Sandel acknowledges that we may sometimes make moral comprises—we may accept the corruption of some good in exchange for the efficiency markets provide. However, Sandel never provides any detailed criteria or even examples for how we should make this trade-off. I think this is because is doing so would require describing and committing to some concrete, normative theory. His reluctance to do so is both understandable (it would take him on quite a tangent) and a bit ironic given his criticism of amoral economists. I think Sandel’s reluctance to defend any particular trade-off reveals just how tricky the thing he’s advocating for (bringing moral discussion into economic decisions) is.</p>
<h1 id="straw-man">Straw man</h1>
<p>The critique about economists being ignorant of the commercialization effect and otherwise believing in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">Homo economicus</a></em> uncritically rings false to me. This is what behavioral economics is all about and many of the works Sandel cites in support of his claims (e.g. the study of crowding out effects with placement of nuclear waste) were produced by economists!</p>
<h1 id="altruism-as-a-limited-resource">Altruism as a limited resource</h1>
<p>Sandel also critiques economists for claiming that we should favor markets to conserve the limited supply of altruism. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing">moral licensing</a> fairly directly suggests this. But I guess you could justly regard this with some skepticism because it’s social psychology and, you know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">the replication crisis</a>…</p>
<h1 id="morality-and-modernity">Morality and modernity</h1>
<p>Even if prosocial sentiment isn’t a depletable resource, I think it’s very plausible that the prosocial impulses of humans aren’t well-adapted to the modern world.</p>
<p>In the ancestral environment, anyone you interacted with was likely someone you knew fairly well. You were almost assured of interacting with them again. We could go on, but suffice it to say that modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_society">mass society</a> is nothing like this.</p>
<p><span class="noted">If our moral impulses are to give due consideration to those we know or those with whom we’ll interact again</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, they suffice for the ancestral environment and are woefully inadequate now. I feel a fondness for my family that militates against profit maximizing when letting them borrow my car but have no such compunction when renting my car out to the man who lives on the other side of city. In our impersonal era, we need social technology to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is an empirical question. I think it’s clear that people do give special moral consideration to those that are close to them. The question that’s left is if the lesser moral consideration allotted to strangers is sufficient to enable modern society without social technologies like markets. If not, do we sacrifice modernity (mass society) in the name of morality?</p>

Economic institutions determine the incentives of and the constraints on economic actors, and shape economic outcomes. As such, they are social decisions, chosen for their consequences. Because different groups and individuals typically benefit from different economic institutions, there is generally a conflict over these social choices, ultimately resolved in favor of groups with greater political power.

<h1 id="scope-of-markets">Scope of markets</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative">There is no alternative</a>. Markets are inescapable. But markets now extend beyond the mere exchange of commercial products into “spheres of life once governed by nonmarket norms”.</p>
<p>The book offers many, many (many) examples of this including:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
[I]n 2001, [a] British novelist […] wrote a book commissioned by Bulgari […]. [The author] agreed to mention Bulgari jewelry in the novel at least a dozen times. The book, aptly titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulgari_Connection">The Bulgari Connection</a> […] more than exceeded the required number of product references, mentioning Bulgari thirty-four times. [One critic] pointed to the clunkiness of the product-laden prose as in sentences such as this: “‘A Bulgari necklace in the hand is worth two in the bush,’ said Doris.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[T]he Campbell Soup Company sent out a free science kit that purported to teach the scientific method. With the use of a slotted spoon (included in the kit), students were shown how to prove that Campbell’s Prego spaghetti sauce was thicker than Ragú, the rival brand. General Mills sent teachers a science curriculum on volcanoes called “Gushers: Wonders of the Earth.” The kit included free samples of its Fruit Gushers candy, with soft centers that “gushed” when bitten. The teacher’s guide suggested that students bite into the Gushers and compare the effect to a geothermal eruption.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
When a bank bought the right to name the Arizona Diamondbacks’ stadium Bank One Ballpark, the deal also required that the team’s broadcasters call each Arizona home run a “Bank One blast.” […] Even sliding into home is now a corporate-sponsored event. [… F]or example, when the umpire calls a runner safe at home plate, a corporate logo appears on the television screen, and the play-by-play announcer must say, “Safe at home. Safe and secure. New York Life.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[The] North Carolina-based charity called Project Prevention, has a market-based solution: offer drug-addicted women $300 cash if they will undergo sterilization or long-term birth control. More than three thousand women have taken [up] the offer since […] 1997.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
Becker even proposed charging admission to refugees fleeing persecution. The free market, he claimed, would make it easy to decide which refugees to accept—those sufficiently motivated to pay the price: “For obvious reasons, political refugees and those persecuted in their own countries would be willing to pay a sizeable fee to gain admission to a free nation. So a fee system would automatically avoid time-consuming hearings about whether they are really in physical danger if they were forced to return home.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[There was another] use of life insurance that arose in the 1980s and 1990s, prompted by the AIDS epidemic. It was called the viatical industry. It consisted of a market in the life insurance policies of people with AIDS and others who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. Here is how it worked: Suppose someone with a $100,000 life insurance policy is told by his doctor that he has only a year to live. And suppose he needs money now for medical care, or perhaps simply to live well in the short time he has remaining. An investor offers to buy the policy from the ailing person at a discount, say, $50,000, and takes over payment of the annual premiums. When the original policyholder dies, the investor collects the $100,000.

<h1 id="the-morality-of-markets">The morality of markets</h1>
<p>This expansion of markets isn’t morally neutral.</p>
<h2 id="for-markets">For markets</h2>
<p>In favor of markets, Sandel lists two moral arguments.</p>
<p>The first is the libertarian, deontological argument about autonomy and liberty. This line of argument suggests that choice and freedom are the default and any abrogation of them must be thoroughly justified (or, for hardliners, is unjustifiable). The argument concludes by suggesting that markets are the natural result of these freedoms. If a market is merely what arises when individuals buy and sell their property, we should expect markets in anything and everything that individuals wish to buy or sell. To stop consenting adults from making such mutually beneficial transactions would be to unjustifiably tyrannize them.</p>
<p>The second argument is the utilitarian one. It emphasizes the ‘mutually beneficial’ part of the transaction. Markets allow trades and, in theory, trades only occur when both parties benefit. If we forbid these trades, we are, in effect, forbidding people from increasing their welfare. If we generalize this from a trade between two people to society as a whole, we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics">the first welfare theorem of economics</a>: Under certain technical conditions, a market equilibrium means that no one can be made better off without making someone worse off. That is, markets allocate goods to those most willing to pay for them.</p>
<h2 id="against-markets">Against markets</h2>
<p>On the ‘against’ side, Sandel again has two arguments.</p>
<p>The first is that markets are not fair. “The fairness objection points to the injustice that can arise when people buy and sell things under conditions of inequality or dire economic necessity. According to this objection, market exchanges are not always as voluntary as market enthusiasts suggest. A peasant may agree to sell his kidney or cornea to feed his starving family, but his agreement may not really be voluntary. He may be unfairly coerced, in effect, by the necessities of his situation.” Sandel goes on to highlight that markets don’t necessarily determine who values any given good most; they only determine who is most willing to pay. Willingness to pay is, in turn, the product of both interest and, crucially, <em>ability to pay</em>.</p>
<p>The second is about corruption. According to this objection, “Certain goods have value in ways that go beyond the utility they give individual buyers and sellers. How a good is allocated may be part of what makes it the kind of good it is.” To allocate a good via markets may, in some cases, degrade it by tainting it with a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred%E2%80%93profane_dichotomy">profane</a> set of norms.</p>
<p>“Tell me more about this corruption”, you, dear reader, conveniently say. “Okay”, I gamely reply.</p>
<p>One way in which markets can be corrupting is that they function like bribes. Sandel gives the example of health insurance discounts for healthy living. They “bypass persuasion and substitute an external reason for an intrinsic one”. I think he then <em>very</em> obliquely suggests that this has first-order ethical consequences because it discourages <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">the cultivation of virtue</a>. Sandel raises similar concerns about the disfiguring of civic and public virtues. It “dishonors their public spirit”.</p>
<p>Another crucial piece of the corruption story is that market incentives are <span class="noted">not merely additive</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Offering money in exchange for some good or task can crowd out and diminish other incentives. As evidence of this, he describes the famous (in certain circles) Israeli day-care study where parents picked up their children <em>later</em> after the introduction of a fine for late pickups <span class="citation" data-cites="gneezy2000">(Gneezy and Rustichini <a href="#ref-gneezy2000">2000</a>)</span>. He also describes a Swiss village where inhabitants were <em>less</em> willing to house nuclear waste if offered annual cash compensation than if done purely out of a sense of civic duty <span class="citation" data-cites="frey1997">(Frey and Oberholzer-Gee <a href="#ref-frey1997">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h2>
<p>We’ll close this section by noting that Sandel does acknowledge that corruption and unfairness aren’t definitive arguments against markets; they’re defeasible. “I do not claim that promoting virtuous attitudes toward the environment, or parenting, or education must always trump competing considerations. Bribery sometimes works. And it may, on occasion, be the right thing to do. […] But it is important to remember that it is bribery we are engaged in, a morally compromised practice that substitutes a lower norm […] for a higher one […].”</p>
<h1 id="economists-what-do-they-know-do-they-know-things-lets-find-out">Economists: What do they know? Do they know things?? Let’s find out!</h1>
<p>I’ll claim that a second major thread of the book is a sort of ethnography of economists.</p>
<p>Parallel to the expansion of markets is the growth of economists’ ambitions. Nowadays, economics is “not merely a set of insights about the production and consumption of material goods but also a science of human behavior.” (See <span class="citation" data-cites="fourcade2015">(Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan <a href="#ref-fourcade2015">2015</a>)</span> for another take on the ambition and position of economists.)</p>
<p>This creeping ambition makes the ‘amorality’ of economists especially troublesome, according to Sandel. “Most economists prefer not to deal with moral questions. […] The price system allocates goods according to people’s preferences; it doesn’t assess those preferences as worthy or admirable or appropriate to the circumstance.” But as markets shift from the allocation of widgets to the allocation of organs, political rights, humans, moral reasoning becomes much more salient.</p>
<p>Combined with this moral abstentionism, economists are (Sandel claims) characterized by a couple peculiar semi-empirical beliefs.</p>
<p>The first strange belief economists have is a willful (?) ignorance of the “commercialization” effect. This is basically just a claim that economists incorrectly disagree that market mechanisms can corrupt the goods they allocate.</p>
<p>The second wrongheaded belief of economists is that prosociality is a limited resource. To describe this belief, he cites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a>: “Like many economists, I do not want to rely too heavily on substituting ethics for self-interest. I think it best on the whole that the requirement of ethical behavior be confined to those circumstances where the price system breaks down […] We do not wish to use up recklessly the scarce resources of altruistic motivation.” Sandel grants that this belief would go a long way toward justifying a multitude of markets, but seems to reject the belief as strange and far-fetched. “It ignores the possibility that our capacity for love and benevolence is not depleted with use but enlarged with practice. Think of a loving couple. If, over a lifetime, they asked little of one another, in hopes of hoarding their love, how well would they fare?”</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="donor-lotteries">Donor lotteries</h1>
<p>Effective altruists have proposed and promoted <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14d/donor_lotteries_demonstration_and_faq/">donor lotteries</a>. Briefly, in a donor lottery, donors pool money for charitable contribution. They’re given lottery tickets in proportion to their contributions. The winner of the lottery gets to decide where the pool of charitable funds should be donated. For example, two people each set aside $1,000 for charitable contribution. They then make an agreement and the winner of the coin flip gets to donate the whole $2,000 to the charity of their choosing.</p>
<p>The primary claimed advantage to these lotteries is economies of scale. It probably doesn’t make sense to spend 100 hours picking the absolutely perfect charity when you’re only disbursing $1000 as a solo donor. It probably does make sense to spend the time to make the decision carefully when disbursing $100,000 as the winner of a donor lottery. Other economies of scale include things like: improved chance of response when asking charities for more information, can fund projects with threshold cost (i.e. we can’t even start the project unless we receive at least $XX,000 dollars).</p>
<h1 id="a-common-concern">A common concern</h1>
<p>Though the original proposals all highlight that the primary benefit of donor lotteries is economies of scale, I’ve heard many in the EA community concerned about alignment of other donors: “What if I don’t trust others in the lottery to do thorough research?” “What if others in the lottery prioritize different cause areas?”</p>
<p>Though early advocates address these concerns briefly, subsequent discussions suggests it might be useful to address these concerns more vividly.</p>
<h1 id="donor-lottery-with-the-devil">Donor lottery with the devil</h1>
<p>I contend you should be willing to enter a donor lottery with the devil (this is the weirdly honorable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil">Faustian</a> devil that respects all his compacts). To see this, we just proceed systematically.</p>
<p>Suppose you and the devil each contribute $10,000 dollars. This is your life savings while the devil merely tosses in a carbuncular carbuncle from his pit of gems and anguish. You flip a fair coin.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First, suppose you abstain: You spend your $10,000 dollars to do good, the devil spends his $X trillion to do evil, and the world hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Suppose you enter the lottery and win: You’ve doubled your money. Because we suppose economies of scale at relatively small amounts like this, the good you can do is more than doubled versus abstaining from the lottery and donating the initial $10,000. On the other side of the bet, the devil is forced to bankroll evil with a mere $X trillion - $10,000. Given the devil’s vast wealth, his plans are unconstrained by funding and the loss of $10,000 represents the evaporation of a single drop in an endless sea of agony. He goes on to do almost exactly as much evil as he would have done without the lottery.</p>
<p>Suppose you enter the lottery and lose: You’ve lost all your money and do no good whatsoever. The devil laughs in triumph, but his heart isn’t really in it. Because, again, the money means nothing to him. He’s working on higher levels in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a>.</p>
<p>Now we can calculate the expected value. The devil does just as much evil in each of the three outcomes. If you abstain from dealing with the devil, you do X good. If you enter the lottery, there’s a 50% chance you do &gt; 2X good and a 50% chance you do 0 good. The expected value of entering the lottery is then &gt; X.</p>
<h1 id="real-donor-lotteries">Real donor lotteries</h1>
<p>Obviously, this isn’t actually the decision that confronts you. But it highlights that the crucial consideration for donor lotteries is economies of scale. You should only worry about your fellow lottery participants insofar as you think they are significantly misaligned with you <em>and</em> have significantly <em>greater</em> economies of scale than you do. If either of these factors is small, you have little to worry about in this regard.</p>]]></summary>

A few weeks ago, I had an unusual — and challenging — assignment: providing a one-hour “tutorial” on the basic science of human-induced climate change to a Federal District Court in San Francisco. Judge William Alsup had requested this tutorial to bring him up to speed on the fundamental science before proceedings begin in earnest in a case brought by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, on behalf of the people of California, against a group of major fossil fuel companies, addressing the costs of climate change caused, they argue, by products those companies have sold.

<p>The most interesting part for me was learning that the basic story I’d heard about the greenhouse effect is so simplified as to be basically wrong. The actual mechanism of warming is examined in more detail <a href="http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=1169">here</a>.</p></li>

<p>The paper’s a bit meandering, but I think the core idea—that a universal basic income and a job guarantee aren’t mutually exclusive or even particularly competitive—is valuable and true. The most import sources of conflict are probably finite supplies of political capital and the enormous complexity of implementing one of these policies, yet alone two.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Under simple majority rule, a largely indifferent majority can approve a result that is intensely opposed by everyone in the minority. If out-and-out bribery were permitted, it would be relatively easy for the minority to bribe the majority faction to defeat the hated policy, and, since the minority does really hate the original proposal, both they and the majority would be, on balance, better off in the post-bribe situation. The original result of majority rule was not Pareto optimal. It was economically inefficient.</p>
<p>In the real world, it is not necessary to buy votes, either of individual voters or their representatives. What we actually see as a part of normal democratic practice is a process of vote trading, sometimes called “logrolling.” Voter 1 cares deeply about issue A but not about issue B. It is then rational for voter 1 to trade his vote on B for voter 2’s vote on A. As a result, everyone is better off. Dennis Mueller, Geoffrey Philpotts, and Jaroslav Vanek demonstrated in a 1972 paper in Public Choice that the analogy between the efficiency of ordinary markets and the efficiency of vote trading in the political sphere is almost perfect.1 In nearly all cases, a system of logrolling will take a society to a state very close to Pareto optimality.Earmarks are merely a special case of logrolling. They enable political minorities (even a minority of one) to have an impact on policy, despite an apathetic or even hostile majority.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
They have driven us away from our houses and gardens to work as prisoners in their factories and their seminaries of vice. <span class="attribution">Thomas Exell, 1838</span>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/">Last time</a>, we reviewed the putting out system—a pre-industrial system of manufacture used in England where workers would take intermediate products home, refine them in some way, and return them to a merchant so that some other worker could perform the next step in the production process. Then, I suggested that this system sounds a lot like the modern gig economy.</p>
<p>Which left us with the question: Why is the gig economy worse than regular, full-time employment (for workers), but putting-out was better than factories (for workers)? We can resolve this tension by either finding that contemporary praise of the putting out system is wrong, finding that criticism of the gig economy is wrong, or (hint, hint) highlighting the disanalogies between the systems.</p>
<h1 id="was-putting-out-actually-preferred-to-factories">Was putting-out actually preferred to factories?</h1>
<h2 id="direct-evidence">Direct evidence</h2>
<p>Obviously, we can’t answer this question definitively and our <span class="noted">direct evidence</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> is weak. One piece of direct evidence we do have is contemporary complaints about the factory system like that in the epigraph. Of course, these are only anecdotes and it’s hard to generalize or be sure they’re representative, but, try as I might, I couldn’t find any anecdotes on the other side of the issue—there were no early factory workers singing praises of child labor and 14 hour days.</p>
<p>Another piece of information which tends to reveal preferences is: “[W]here alternatives to factory employment were available, there is evidence that workers flocked to them. […] [D]espite the abysmally low level to which wages fell [in the non-factory cotton weaving industry], a force of domestic cotton weavers numbering some 250,000 survived well into the nineteenth century.” <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> It is, of course, impossible to be certain that worker aversion to factories is what drove this behavior.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>One last claim from this angle: It seems widely acknowledged that workers struggled to transition to the factory model. Factory work was perhaps never fully accepted by adults forced to transition to it and was only accepted by children who had grown up working in factories or expecting to work in factories (a la “Science advances one funeral at a time.”). “The early industrial capitalists spent a great deal of effort and time in the social conditioning of their labor force” <span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2001">(Mokyr <a href="#ref-mokyr2001">2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="indirect-evidence">Indirect evidence</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/#transition">Last time, we covered some of the reasons that factory work might have been unappealing.</a></p>
<p>I trust that the reader can call to mind or find lots more about the abysmal conditions of early factories.</p>
<h2 id="an-objection">An objection</h2>
<p>One objection the attentive reader might raise is: If the workers didn’t like factories, why did they transition to them? Standard economic logic dictates that actors don’t make self-defeating choices so they must have actually preferred factories. The story here is that the productivity of factories was so great and decreased prices so much that the comparatively inefficient putting-out system was no longer sustainable. Factory driven changes in market conditions meant workers were faced with the choice of penury or factory work. <span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2001">(Mokyr <a href="#ref-mokyr2001">2001</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="summation">Summation</h2>
<p>I’ll readily admit that no particular piece of evidence here is impressive. In the aggregate though, I’m still fairly ready to believe that workers preferred the putting-out system to factory work.</p>
<h1 id="is-flsa-work-actually-preferred-to-gig-work">Is FLSA work actually preferred to gig work?</h1>
<p>(FLSA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> and we’ll use work where these rules apply as a conceptual shorthand for ‘normal’ work.)</p>
<p>Sadly, the intervening centuries don’t mean that we’re drowning in evidence on these questions. Everyone in the nascent gig economy literature seems to lament that the best source of data is a 2005 (!) BLS report on <em>Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangements</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="bls2005">(Labor Statistics (BLS). <a href="#ref-bls2005">2004</a>)</span>. Obviously, there wasn’t much of a gig economy in 2005 so data from that report is best interpreted with caution.</p>
<h2 id="direct-evidence-1">Direct evidence</h2>
<p>Caveats aside, here’s a key finding: By their narrowest definition of contingent worker (wage and salary workers who indicate that they expect to work in their current job for 1 year or less and who have worked for their current employer for 1 year or less) 63% of workers in these contingent and alternative arrangements would have preferred a job that was permanent. A somewhat broader definition of contingent worker (includes the self-employed) drops that to 57%.</p>
<p>Another story you can tell as to worker attitudes on contingent work: “When workers were in a strong bargaining position from 1995 to 2001, the share of contingent workers fell. Gig jobs declined as a share of the economy when workers had more bargaining leverage during the employment boom—the first internet boom—of the second Clinton Administration. This suggests that it is employers, not employees, who are pushing the gig economy.” <span class="citation" data-cites="friedman2014">(Friedman <a href="#ref-friedman2014">2014</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="indirect-evidence-1">Indirect evidence</h2>
<p>There are, of course, many disadvantages to gig work which might cause workers to dislike it. For one, gig workers tend to earn less than traditional employees after controlling for education <span class="citation" data-cites="friedman2014">(Friedman <a href="#ref-friedman2014">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There’s also a whole bundle of benefits mandated by the FLSA in the U.S. Gig workers are not guaranteed these things. The benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimum wage</li>
<li>overtime compensation</li>
<li>unemployment compensation</li>
<li>family and medical leave</li>
<li>employer payroll taxes</li>
<li>collective bargaining rights</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, a majority of workers in FLSA positions are offered the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>health insurance</li>
<li>retirement</li>
<li>life insurance</li>
<li>paid sick leave</li>
<li>paid vacations</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the arguments in favor of gig work are very similar to those advanced in favor of putting-out in the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/#transition">previous post in the series</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summation-1">Summation</h2>
<p>Ultimately, though I’m far from certain, I find the evidence above somewhat persuasive. It seems likely to me that most workers in the gig economy would prefer other arrangements.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It’s hard to be certain, but it seems that both claims might be true. Putting-out was better than factories for workers and gig work is worse than FLSA employment for most workers. That means our only way out is to discern the crucial differences between now and then. Next time.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Ethics is fundamentally about ‘ought’. What ought we to do? Which actions are proscribed and which prescribed? Among all available actions, which should we actually pursue? I think we can formalize this basic understanding and draw some interesting conclusions.</p>
<p>For any given ethical decision, we have some nonempty set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> (depending on how we individuate, possibly infinite) of possible actions. But, alas, we cannot perform all these actions; only one. So an ethical theory is something that for every possible <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> selects a distinguished element <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>. That is, an ethical theory is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function">choice function</a> over nonempty sets of actions.</p>
<p>In the rest of the post, we’ll discuss what properties such an ethical choice function might have and build up an understanding of how the tools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order theory</a> might be applied to metaethical reasoning.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="one-elementaction">One element/action</h1>
<p>Let’s try to think about this ethical choice function in a little more detail. We’ll start with the simplest case:</p>
<div class="single-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>sets with only a single element. Here, our choice function simply plucks out this single element. In symbols, <span class="math inline">\(\forall a \in \mathcal{A} : f(\{a\}) = a\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ethics-col">
<p>ethical choices with only one possible action (i.e. there is not even a choice between action and inaction). Here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can">we’d hope our ethical theory would recommend the only possible action</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 id="two-elementsactions">Two elements/actions</h1>
<p>On to the next step:</p>
<div class="double-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>Now, we want to define our choice function over two element sets as well. In order to relate the two elements in each set, we must talk about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">binary relation</a> that we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span> (read <span class="math inline">\(a \prec b\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is worse than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> or as <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is better than <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). What properties should this relation have? We’ll make our relation <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation">irreflexive</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It should also be <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_relation">asymmetric</a></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. If we stick to our earlier claim that an ethical theory must pick a distinguished element “for every possible” <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> (which, tendentiously, we will for the rest of the post), then we’re also requesting <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_relation">totality</a></span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. (Totality also demands an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence relation</a>. We choose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics)">identity relation</a> for the remaining discussion.)</p>
<p>So our choice function applies our irreflexive, asymmetric binary relation to our two element set and always chooses the better element of the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="ethics-col">
<p>What happens when our ethical theory needs to actually start pulling its weight and giving guidance between two different actions (call them A and B)? At its simplest, the theory can either declare that A is better or instead that B is better. Or it might declare that the two actions are incomparable—neither stands anywhere in ethical relation to the other. This is often unsatisfactory (as suggested in a <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-examples/">previous post</a>). So we’ll provisionally adhere to the introduction’s demand that our ethical theory never avail itself of this escape hatch. This demand for comprehensive guidance means that we also need a notion of moral equivalence. At a minimum, every action must be morally equivalent to itself. (Our ethical theory ought not to claim that action A is better than A.)</p>
<p>All of that is to say, when presented with two different actions, our ethical theory always recommends one or the other as the better to pursue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h1 id="three-elementsactions">Three elements/actions</h1>
<p>Now it really starts to get complicated.</p>
<div class="triple-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>We’ve defined our choice function for sets <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> of cardinality <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. What about <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>?</p>
<p>(These next several paragraphs are a belaboring of what are presumably widely shared intuitions about transitivity and using a binary relation to pick the greatest element in a set.)</p>
<p>Let’s try to build it out of what we already know. For any given <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>, if we look at the binary relation as defined on <span class="math inline">\(a ? b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b ? c\)</span>, we have 9 cases to consider:</p>

<p>I’ve taken the liberty of categorizing the rows. Those in category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span> rely on <span class="noted">transitivity</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> of our binary relation. Those in category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> rely on transitivity of the identity relation. In category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Y}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a ? c\)</span> is underdetermined, but each <span class="math inline">\(\prec b\)</span>. In category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a ? c\)</span> is again undefined but <span class="math inline">\(b \prec\)</span> each.</p>
<p>Transitivity of the identity relation strikes me as /very/ innocuous. Transitivity of the binary relation also seems very intuitive to me, but some contest it. See, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="rachels1998">(Rachels <a href="#ref-rachels1998">1998</a>)</span>. In category $, because our choice function only needs to select the one best element, we don’t care that <span class="math inline">\(a ? c\)</span> is undetermined—<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is greater than both. It’s only in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span>, that we must again resort to our binary relation to settle whether element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is greater. Putting that all together, we rewrite the table:</p>

<p>How does our ethical theory cope when asked to recommend among three distinct, ethically relevant actions (call them A, B, and C)?

<p>6 of the 8 (i.e. all but rows 2 and 7 in the table) are perfectly reasonable and take a form like ‘A is better than B which is better than C with is the worst.’. However, 2 of the 8 pairwise combinations (i.e. rows 2 and 7 in the table) produce cycles like ‘A is better than B which is better than C which is better than A which is better than B’ which continues ad nauseum.</p>
<p>Needless to say, permitting cycles in our ethical theory has many strange consequences. If we wish to forbid these cycles, the property we must appeal to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">transitivity</a>. Nevertheless, the transitivity of ‘better than’ is actually an open question in the philosophical community. See, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="rachels1998">(Rachels <a href="#ref-rachels1998">1998</a>)</span> for an entry point into that discussion.</p>
<p>Since my intuitions argue in favor of transitivity being important, we’ll assume that for the remainder of the post.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we’ve upgraded our ethical theory to work across sets of three actions by doing pairwise comparisons and aggregating them to find the best option subject to certain reasonableness constraints.</p>

<h1 id="and-beyond">And beyond</h1>
<p>This is quickly becoming tedious. Surely, we can’t hope to construct the choice function for each possible cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> on unto infinity. As it turns out we don’t need to. We now have all the tools we need to generalize.</p>
<div class="general-choice">
<div class="math-col">
<p>If we review all the properties we’ve accumulated on our binary relation, it is (somewhat redundantly) irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive, trichotomous, and total. That is, our binary relation is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order#Strict_total_order">strict total order</a>. And the choice function we’ve been implementing so far simply picks the greatest element in each subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. We can extend this indefinitely. A total order on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> with the property that every nonempty subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> has a greatest element is a (inverted) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order">well-order</a>. <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Finite_Totally_Ordered_Set_is_Well-Ordered">Every finite total order is also a well-order</a>. So we can generalize this approach to the choice function to arbitrary subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> of finite cardinality <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We leave the issue of infinite <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> aside for the moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="ethics-col">
<p>We can, in principle, follow this same basic approach to scale our ethical theory to choose among an arbitrary number of actions. We just keep making pairwise comparisons until we conclude what the best option is (We’re guaranteed a unique answer as long as the pairwise comparisons obey transitivity.).</p>

<p>We started with the claimed insight that ethical theories are choice functions—for each moral decision, an ethical theory must pick a single distinguished action (that which we ought to perform) from the set of all available actions. From there, we built up a procedure for turning a ‘better than’ binary relation into a well-order. Once we have a well-order with its greatest element guarantee, a choice function is trivial. That is, if the problem of ethics is to find a choice function, an ethical well-order is a good candidate for that choice function.</p>
<p>Along the way, we made several choices about how our choice function and binary relation ought to behave. While these choices weren’t arbitrary, they were only sparsely defended. I plan to examine these assumptions and alternatives in more depth in future posts.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="von-neumannmorgenstern-utility-theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</a> says that, “under certain axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he or she is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future”. But the somewhat sloppy way I like to think of it is this: If a person has merely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility">ordinal preferences</a> (e.g. I prefer an apple to a banana but can’t or won’t quantify the magnitude of that preference. The preceding information alone isn’t enough to conclude how I’d feel about one apple vs. two bananas.) and reasons well under uncertainty, we can transform those ordinal preferences into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility function</a> (e.g. I like apples exactly twice as much as bananas and would be indifferent between an apple and two bananas (ignoring diminishing marginal utility for the same of exposition).).</p>
<p>This transformation is often useful because a cardinal utility function is much richer and more informative than an ordinal utility function. The extra information is useful, for example, in sidestepping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s impossibility theorem</a> (which says that it’s impossible to have a good voting system if you only ask people for their ordering of candidates).</p>
<h1 id="interactive-vnm">Interactive VNM</h1>
<p>The standard descriptions of the mechanism of the VNM utility theorem may be a little opaque. But because the theorem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof">constructive</a>, we can actually give people a feel for it by putting them ‘inside’ the mechanism and showing them the result. That’s what we attempt here.</p>
<p>In the first text area, enter a list of goods (each on a separate line) for which you’d like to generate a utility function. It starts with a few sample goods, but you’re free to add, remove or otherwise alter these.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided upon the goods you’re interested in, you can proceed to the next step. Here, you’ll be presented with a series of lotteries. In each lottery, you have to decide whether you prefer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> lottery tickets for one good over <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> lottery tickets for the other good, or if you’re indifferent. If your lottery ticket is drawn, you win whatever good is on the ticket. You can register your answer as to which set of tickets you prefer by clicking on one of the three blue boxes.</p>
<p>For example, if you mildly prefer bananas to carrots, you’d click on the banana box when presented with one lottery ticket for each. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot, by your lights (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>). On the other hand (because your preference was only mild), you’d click on the carrot box if offered 100 carrot tickets vs. 1 banana ticket. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 101\)</span>).</p>
<p>After you’ve repeated this process enough, we can deduce what your favorite good of all the listed goods is. With this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire">numéraire</a>, we can start to visualize your utility function and do so with a chart that appears at the bottom. But, of course, we still have uncertainty about the relative value of these goods. Based on the questions you answer, we know upper and lower bounds for your value (a carrot is better than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100}\)</span> banana but worse than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1}\)</span> banana). Over time, by answering more questions, we can refine these intervals until they’re arbitrarily small.</p>

<h2 id="aside">Aside</h2>
<p>I can also imagine the basic setup of VNM as useful for preference elicitation. If you ask respondents in a survey to directly assign cardinal values to various outcomes, I suspect they will have little intuition for the task and generate poor estimates. Presenting them with a series of lotteries is at least a different task and it may turn out to be an easier or more accurate one.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Pareto improvement as partial order</title>
    <link href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-partial-order/" />
    <id>https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-partial-order/</id>
    <published>2018-05-07T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2018-05-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We covered the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto improvement</a> in the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-examples/">preceding post</a>. I briefly alluded to the fact that it’s a strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial order</a>. Let’s explore that a bit more.</p>
<h1 id="partial-order">Partial order</h1>
<p>A strict partial order is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">binary relation</a> that is irreflexive (no element precedes itself), and transitive. Pareto improvement satisfies both of these criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Irreflexive: <span class="math inline">\(\neg (A \prec A)\)</span></dt>
<dd>No scenario is a Pareto improvement over itself because no one strictly prefers it (person 1 doesn’t prefer scenario A to scenario A), trivially.
</dd>
<dt>Transitive: <span class="math inline">\(A \prec B, B \prec C \Rightarrow A \prec C\)</span></dt>
<dd>If arbitrary scenario B is a Pareto improvement over arbitrary scenario A and arbitrary scenario C is a Pareto improvement over scenario B, then scenario C is a Pareto improvement over scenario A. In other words, if no one is worse off in scenario B than scenario A and no one is worse off in scenario C than scenario B, then, clearly, no one is worse off in scenario three than scenario A. And if at least one person is better off in scenario B than scenario A and at least one person is better off in scenario C than scenario B, then, clearly, at least one person is better off in scenario C than scenario A.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Alternatively, we can just take the shortcut of noting that Pareto improvement is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_order">componentwise order</a> of the total orders of individual preferences.</p>
<h1 id="total-order">Total order</h1>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/pareto-examples/">preceding post</a>, we objected to the fact that Pareto improvement is partial—unable to render judgment between many scenarios and declare one as better than another despite our strongest intuitions. <span class="noted">We could remedy this problem if instead we had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. We turn a strict partial order into a strict total order by adding the following property:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Trichotomous: <span class="math inline">\((A \prec B) \lor (B \prec A) \lor (A = B)\)</span></dt>
<dd>Arbitrary scenario A is preferred to arbitrary scenario B or scenario B is preferred to scenario A or scenario A and B are the same.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The question is, how to introduce this property? If we’re able to introduce this property while retaining the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thick-ethical-concepts/">thinness</a> (i.e. value neutrality) of Pareto improvement, that would be a very interesting thing indeed. We would have a tool to judge any and every policy, any and every state of society, any and every counterfactual world while keeping our private values out of the decision. We would, perhaps, have “solved” objective morality.</p>
<p><!-- In fact, we could define an "index of totality" for a partially ordered set $P$ as $\frac{\text{no. of antichains in }P}{|P|}$ where $\frac{1}{|P|}$ means all elements in $P$ are incomparable to each other (e.g. $(0, 2)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(2, 0)$ when lifting $\lt$ via the componentwise order) and $\frac{|P|}{|P|}$ means all elements are comparable to each other (e.g. $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$). Thus, an index of totality at $1$ actually indicates a total order. With this notion in mind, instead of demanding a total order, we could instead try to fix the problems of Pareto improvement by demanding some partial order with a sufficiently high index of totality. All that said, we'll set this idea aside for the moment. --></p>

<li><div id="fn1">
<p>You may object that we’re making too big a leap. The problem we outlined is only that Pareto improvement is too partial a partial order. We don’t necessarily need a total order.

</blockquote>
<h1 id="putting-out-system">Putting-out system</h1>
<p>Between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild#Fall_of_the_guilds">guild system</a> and the full steam <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, England briefly used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putting-out_system">putting-out system</a>. Under this system, finished goods were assembled not in factories or dedicated workshops, but component-by-component in a multitude of homes and cottages.</p>
<p>For example (illustrative hypothetical based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing_by_pre-industrial_methods">Wikipedia</a>): One worker would trundle their hand cart to the market, drop off cleaned wool in exchange for a piece rate payment, and the merchant would dispatch them with a new load of wool. That merchant would take this cleaned wool and give it to another independent worker for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding">carding</a>. The carder would take the cleaned wool home, the family would process it in their home, and then return to the market in a couple weeks to give the merchant carded wool. This staged process would repeat with a separate family taking home loads of inputs and returning outputs for each subsequent stage in the process—spinning, plying, weaving, etc. When the final task was complete, the merchant would take the finished goods to a market or store and sell them to consumers. In this way, the task was broken down into small components and coordinated by the merchants—somewhat like a (spatially and temporally) disaggregated assembly line.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="transition">Transition</h2>
<p>But this system didn’t last forever. Early factories soon arose and by 1850, piece work was all but dead. <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> The factory had won out. To what effect?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="mokyr2001">(Mokyr <a href="#ref-mokyr2001">2001</a>)</span> highlights a number of detriments unique to factory work:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Commuting</dt>
<dd>Walking to work (the only widely accessible form of transit then available) reduces time available for leisure and so reduces welfare in ways that don’t show up in the most obvious measures (e.g. GDP).
</dd>
<dt>Leisure-income choice</dt>
<dd>In the putting out system, households (this unjustly ignores intra-household decision-making) could choose how much time they wanted to devote to work in very fine-grained increments. With the factory system, work became “all or nothing”. For many, this reduced choice would have reduced welfare. I’ve often heard even modern coworkers wish for an option to work only, say, three days a week.
</dd>
<dt>Multitasking</dt>
<dd>The shift to factory work eliminated the opportunity for multitasking. The most important example of multitasking available in the putting-out system was looking after children while performing other work.
</dd>
<dt>Working environment</dt>
<dd>Early factories were nasty, brutish and liable to shorten the lives of their workers.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we listen to <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> tell it, factories were a disaster for workers and to the benefit of only the capitalists:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he origin and success of the factory lay not in technological superiority, but in the substitution of the capitalist’s for the worker’s control of the work process and the quantity of output, in the change in the workman’s choice from one of how much to work and produce […] to one of whether or not to work at all, which of course is hardly much of a choice.
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll take a moment to explicitly note this for the ensuing discussion: An avowed leftist publishing in the <em>Review of radical political economics</em> comes out strongly in favor of putting-out over factory work. I suspect many other leftists would have similar sympathies.</p>
<h1 id="the-gig-economy">The gig economy</h1>
<p>I hope the earlier description of the putting-out system echoed. To me, it sounds a great deal like a technologically limited gig economy. In both systems, workers have considerable freedom over how much work they perform, but not which tasks. Their tasks are assigned by a central clearinghouse which also mediates their relationship with the final consumer. Unlike freelancers, workers have relationships with only one or a few buyers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony">monopsony</a>/ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopsony">oligopsony</a>). Unlike modern full-time employees, in both systems, workers have very limited physical interactions with their employer.</p>
<p>If you accept the aptness of this analogy, we’re left with a confusion. Why was the putting-out system considered better than full-time, centralized employment while the gig economy is often considered worse? Especially from the leftist perspective?</p>
<div class="skippable">
<h2 id="gig-hate">Gig hate</h2>
<p>If you doubt that leftists look dimly on the gig economy, look no further:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/gig-economy-dpd-courier-taylor-review">The gig economy is being fuelled by exploitation, not innovation</a></li>

<h1 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h1>
<p>We have three ways to reconcile the apparent conflict. People are wrong about the putting-out system, people are wrong about the gig economy, or the two systems are crucially different.

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of time reading. But I’m not actually reading very quickly. The typical educated adult reads at about 200 to 400 <abbr title="words per minute">wpm</abbr> (for context, a speaking rate of 150 to 160 <abbr title="words per minute">wpm</abbr> is comfortable). Given that, it seems <em>possible</em> that a better understanding of reading could help me spend that time better. So I read <span class="citation" data-cites="rayner2016">(Rayner et al. <a href="#ref-rayner2016">2016</a>)</span>. Spoiler: It didn’t transform the way I read (and reaffirmed that speed reading is rather less than advocates claim), but it was definitely interesting. The regurgitation that follows focuses more on the article’s description of the ‘how’ of reading and less on the debunking of speed reading.</p>
<p><a href="#summary" class="no-home">Summary</a></p>
<h1 id="speech-writing">Speech &gt; writing</h1>
<p>Speech is prior to writing. Spoken language is thought to have originated around 100,000 years ago; written language 5,000 years ago. All human societies have spoken language; not so for writing. No natural language is purely written. Children learn to speak and interpret language without explicit instruction; not so for reading. Thus, we reach the claim that reading and writing is an “optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on” <span class="citation" data-cites="mcguinness1997">(McGuinness <a href="#ref-mcguinness1997">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>After this bolting is complete, many of our reading processes are still mediated by our more fundamental spoken language processes—even during silent reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, when researches asked silent readers to rapidly decide whether words belonged to a category, homophones produced incorrect “yes”es 19% of the time (whether “meet” belongs in the category food) compared to the base rate for orthographically similar words of 3% (<span class="noted">whether “melt” belongs in the category food</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>). The implication here is that we have difficulty translating directly from visual input to units of meaning and this visual-meaning connection is often mediated by the auditory representation.</p></li>
<li><p>In a different study, researchers asked readers to repeat an irrelevant word or phrase aloud while reading in an effort to impede any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization">subvocalization</a>. These readers performed worse on a subsequent test of comprehension than those asked to repeat a sequence of finger taps.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So our brains aren’t great at reading. But neither are our eyes.</p>

The next circle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parafovea">parafovea</a> which extends from 1° to 5° from the center of vision. The periphery encompasses anything beyond this.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/how-do-we-read/fovea.jpg" alt="Zones of the visual field" /><figcaption>Zones of the visual field</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a word is presented so briefly that readers have no time to move their eyes, accuracy is high when the word is centered in the fovea. But accuracy drops off rapidly till it’s no better than chance at around 3° from the center of vision.</p>
<p>Part of the story here is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell">cones</a> (the detail-oriented, bright light photoreceptors) are concentrated in the fovea while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell">rods</a> (sensitive primarily to brightness and motion in dim light) increase in concentration with distance from the fovea. Yet more interesting, inputs from rods are pooled before being relayed to the brain. That is, if half the rods in a group are fully lit and half are in total darkness, the brain will receive a signal indicating middling illumination. Cones, in contrast, would signal a light/dark boundary here because each has an unmediated connection to the brain.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
<p>Because our region of focus is so limited, readers must necessarily move the focus of their eyes along text via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccades</a> (short, ballistic movements of both eyes)</p>

<p>Saccades</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each saccade lasts roughly 20 to 35 ms and spans (in English) about 7 letters.</p>
<p>“Return sweeps” (long saccades moving your eye to the beginning of the next line) are often imperfect but are quickly corrected with a follow-up saccade.</p>
<h2 id="fixation">Fixation</h2>
<p>Between saccades, the eyes are fairly stable. These stable periods are called fixations and last about 250 ms. However, studies have found that reading behavior and comprehension is unaffected when each word disappears 60ms after the beginning of fixation (that is, our eyes continue to stare at now blank space). The remaining portion of the 250ms appears to be devoted to some essential higher-level processing which most occur before we can proceed to the next word.</p>
<p>For many words, adult readers <span class="noted">recognize all the letters simultaneously</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. This is limited by visual acuity as we discussed above—the word identification span is only about 7 characters to the right of the fixation point. Thus, long words require at least a saccade and multiple fixations.</p>
<h1 id="from-squiggles-to-meaning">From squiggles to meaning</h1>
<p><span class="noted">Words are the basic unit of meaning in language</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. So they are the first step in building from raw visual input to real communication. In fact, studies indicate that word-identification ability is the best determinant of reading speed (though skilled readers also have shorter fixations, longer saccades and fewer <span class="noted">regressions</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>)</p>
<p>In turn, the best determinant of word-identification ability is <span class="noted">the frequency with which the reader has seen the word</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Common words like ‘house’ are more quickly recognized than uncommon words like ‘abode’. This word-frequency effect has been measured in lexical decision tasks (Is the string of characters a word or not?), naming tasks (Read a word aloud as quickly as possible), and categorization tasks (Does the given word belong in a semantic category?).</p>
<p>Some words (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph">homographs</a>) <span class="noted">can’t possibly be assigned a unique meaning without context. Sentence context helps disambiguate these words.</span><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> Interestingly, contexts that make the next word very predictable often lead to the word being skipped entirely (i.e. the saccade moves over the word entirely and it receives no fixation). This happens about 30% of the time.</p>
<p>(This all begins to sound very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian</a>.)</p>
<p>Readers slow down a bit at the end of sentences and phrases. So there is some yet higher-level processing that occurs even after words have been been translated into units of meaning.</p>
<h1 id="speed-reading">Speed reading</h1>
<p>Much of the technology (e.g. Spritz) and teaching around speed reading supposes that the problem is just about getting your eyes through the words as fast as possible. This isn’t accurate. The limiting factors for reading speed seem to be primarily cognitive.</p>
<p>Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) precludes regressing to previous words, but this is a normal and healthy part of reading. Preventing it impairs comprehension. Additionally, having a preview of words to come (impossible in the RSVP setup) in the parafovea somewhat increases reading speed. All you get in exchange for these losses is the omission of saccades. But saccades aren’t wasted time, relevant cognition can continue while the eyes are in transit.</p>
<p>Speed reading advocates often suggest eliminating subvocalization. As discussed earlier, this is extremely difficult given the primacy of spoken language and impairs comprehension.</p>
<p>They also often advocate for “taking in” larger chunks of text—whole lines, paragraphs or even pages of text at once. As the discussion of the visual acuity highlights this is impossible.</p>
<h1 id="reading-better">Reading better</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, more exposure to a word makes its subsequent recognition faster. Thus more reading will improve the all-important speed of word identification. More reading will also improve your predictions of upcoming words and improve your ability to synthesize and extrapolate from missing information (The authors suggest that this is part of what’s happening in speed readers. Intelligent people that spend a lot of time reading are good at filling in the gaps to compensate for their low comprehension at the purely linguistic level.)</p>
<p>The authors also highlight that skimming is sometimes appropriate and merited. When this is the case, skimmers should pay special attention to headings, paragraph structure and key words. Paying equal attention to all content is a poor use of limited time.</p>
<p>If you find the modesty of these suggestions discouraging, I quite understand. But, the authors conclude that, as in so many things, there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. There’s a fairly inescapable trade-off between speed and accuracy in reading.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Speech is more fundamental than writing. Reading is mediated by spoken language in surprising ways.</p>
<p>Our eyes have very limited acuity. As such, we must saccade from one word to the next. In between saccades, we fixate. In each fixation, a word is most often recognized as a gestalt unit. Our ability to recognize words depends on both local context (other words in the sentence) and a larger context (our history of reading and our knowledge of the world).</p>
<p>Speed reading doesn’t work.</p>
<p>The only credible suggestion for becoming a faster reader is: Read more.</p>

    <title>A visual intuition for the instrumental argument for equality</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="equality">Equality</h2>
<p><span class="noted">Our moral intuition</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> easily suggests that equality has moral value. The world in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe_economy">Robinson Crusoe and Friday</a> share coconuts seems vastly better than the world in which Crusoe sits on his coconut throne and doles out the barest sustenance to Friday. It is easy to leap from this intuition to the conclusion that equality is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value">intrinsic</a> good. But, in this post, let’s make a stop at the proposition that equality is instead only an instrumental good.</p>
<h2 id="equality-instrumentally">Equality instrumentally</h2>
<p>If our sole intrinsic good is something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utils</a>, we will still often prefer equality to inequality. What sorcery could introduce such deontological concepts into our consequentialist paradise? The incantation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility">“diminishing marginal utility”</a>. It is an empirical proposition (and mostly fact) that humans do not enjoy their 10th print copy of even their favorite book as much as the first. Thus, a bibliomaniac can improve overall well-being by sharing the love. Losing copy 10 hurts less than gaining copy 1 helps.</p>
<h1 id="visualizing-the-utilitarian-consequences-of-income-distribution">Visualizing the utilitarian consequences of income distribution</h1>
<p>We can start to build a visual intuition for this instrumental egalitarianism. Suppose we have an income distribution that looks like this:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<form>
<fieldset class="draw">
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Income in dollars by percentile for hypothetical population</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="income-distribution">

</div>
</figure>
<button type="button">
<p>Clear</p>
</button>
</fieldset>
</form>
<p>And suppose that the marginal utility of the last dollar of income looks like this:</p>
<form>
<fieldset class="draw">
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Hypothetical marginal utility of last dollar over a range of incomes</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="marginal-utility">

</div>
</figure>
<button type="button">
<p>Clear</p>
</button>
</fieldset>
</form>
<p>Then, via some math (check <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/utilitarian-egalitarianism-notebook/">the preceding post</a> for details), we can figure out the utility across the population:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<p>Utility by percentile for hypothetical populations based on income distribution and marginal utility of money.</p>
</figcaption>
<div id="utility-distribution">

</div>
</figure>
<p>In addition to showing the utility distribution for the income distribution specified in the first chart, we also show the utility distribution of a hypothetical perfectly egalitarian population (with the same total income). Finally, the dashed lines show the mean utility in each population.</p>
<p>The default functions plotted in the first two charts (income distribution and marginal utility of last dollar) are merely suggestive and the true fact of the matter is empirically determined. If you don’t like the suggestions, feel free to draw in your own functions (click and drag). The final chart showing the population utility distribution will update accordingly.</p>
<p>Some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>See what happens when you draw in a more aggressively inegalitarian income distribution</li>
<li>See what happens when you draw in an egalitarian income distribution</li>
<li>See what happens when you draw in constant marginal returns</li>
<li>See what happens when you draw in increasing marginal returns</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>For any given level of total income, diminishing marginal returns imply that an egalitarian distribution of that income produces greater average and total utility. This is reflected visually by the dashed mean for the inegalitarian utility distribution being below the dashed mean for the egalitarian utility distribution.</p>
<h1 id="caveats">Caveats</h1>
<p>The presentation here is highly simplified in a way that’s probably misleading. Some complications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Income isn’t the only source of utility. To the extent that other sources of utility are uncorrelated with income, acknowledging other contributors to utility would tend to reduce the relative importance of inequality. For example, if income accounted for only 10% of people’s utility, even radical inequality would mean only a relatively minor missed opportunity.</li>
<li>Diminishing marginal utility isn’t the only route by which inequality may affect utility. People may have direct preferences about the income distribution (i.e. envy and resentment). The impact of this on our analysis depends on the nature of these preferences. If people’s preferences are sensitive to absolute differences in terms of dollars, our story so far understates the importance of equality. If their preferences are sensitive only to their rank in the overall distribution, most egalitarian improvements are irrelevant so this consideration can be omitted.</li>

<blockquote>
So [the visiting economist] begins. The efficiency with which an economy’s resources are allocated is a critical determinant of the economy’s performance, he says. Efficiency, in turn, requires aligning the incentives of households and businesses with social costs and benefits. The incentives faced by entrepreneurs, investors, and producers are particularly important when it comes to economic growth. Growth needs a system of property rights and contract enforcement that will ensure those who invest can retain the returns on their investments. And the economy must be open to ideas and innovations from the rest of the world.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
By the time the economist stops, it appears as if he has laid out a full-fledged neoliberal agenda. A critic in the audience will have heard all the code words: efficiency, incentives, property rights, sound money, fiscal prudence. Yet the universal principles that the economist describes are in fact quite open-ended. … And therein lies the central conceit, and the fatal flaw, of neoliberalism: the belief that first-order economic principles map onto a unique set of policies, approximated by a Thatcher–Reagan-style agenda.

<p>Briefly, a scenario (<span class="noted">canonically, a distribution of resources across individuals</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto optimal</a> in a set of scenarios if no other scenario is weakly preferred by <em>all</em> individuals (to be more precise, scenario A is a Pareto improvement over scenario B if no individual prefers scenario B to scenario A and at least one individual prefers scenario A). An immediate consequence of this definition is that Pareto improvement is a strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial order</a>. That is, in opposition to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a>, not all pairs of scenarios can be ranked; sometimes we can only throw up our hands and say, “I don’t know which is better.

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch.
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that, <span class="noted">in common use</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the term ‘tyranny of the majority’ conflates two importantly distinct concepts.</p>
<h1 id="invidious">Invidious</h1>
<p>The first sense in which one can mean tyranny of the majority is the one highlighted in the epigraph. In this form, some passing whim of the majority overrules and outweighs the critical interest of the minority. The wolves’ purely gustatory (pretending that wolves aren’t obligate carnivores) interest in the lamb trumps the lamb’s literally vital interest in living. Real world examples in this category include: <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws">Jim Crow laws</a></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage">marriage for same-sex couples</a>; often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">Nimbyism</a>.</p>
<h1 id="a-shift-in-perspective">A shift in perspective</h1>
<p>Tyranny of the majority is often framed as a majority violating the political and moral rights of the minority. Once we permit ourselves the ontological spookiness that is ‘rights’, it seems only fair to allow ourselves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory#Interpersonal_utility_comparison">interpersonal utility comparison</a>. With these tools, we can reframe and make precise the tyranny of the majority described above.</p>
<p>Invidious tyranny of the majority occurs when the weak preferences of many outweigh the strong preferences of the few such that <span class="noted">the actual outcome doesn’t maximize utility/satisfaction of preferences</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For example, the lamb gets -10 utils from being eaten. Each wolf gets 2 utils from eating the lamb. The aggregate net utility of eating the lamb is -6, but their are two votes for and only 1 against. On the other hand, if the wolves were fanatical gourmands that each got 15 utils from eating the lamb, <span class="noted">we wouldn’t call their feast a tyranny of the majority</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In symbols,</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/-2878446764376890000.svg" title="
d_{v} = \text{argmax}_{d \in D} \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} v(\theta, d) \\
d_{u} = \text{argmax}_{d \in D} \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} u(\theta, d)
" /></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the set of all possible outcomes/policies, <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> is the set of all voters, <span class="math inline">\(v(\theta, d)\)</span> is either <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> based on whether <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> votes for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(u(\theta, d)\)</span> is between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> based on how much utility <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> gets from <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Tyranny of the majority occurs when <span class="math inline">\(d_{v}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{u}\)</span> disagree even for honest voters (i.e. those that don’t try to pursue any strategy but just vote their preferences in the most naive way possible).</p>
<h1 id="innocuous">Innocuous</h1>
<p>From this perspective, it becomes clearer what in innocuous majoritarian tyranny is. It’s when individuals in the majority care about the outcome less than the minority, but honoring the majority’s preferences still maximizes aggregate utility. (Presumably/hopefully, no one cries “tyranny” when the majority both has more numbers <em>and</em> cares more.)</p>
<p>If you have 10 wolves, each of whom get 2 utils from eating the original lamb, the aggregate utility of eating the lamb is 10 (<span class="math inline">\(10 * 2 - 10 = 10\)</span>) versus 0 for abstaining. Thus, eating maximizes overall utility despite the fact that individual preference of each wolf is weaker than the lamb’s.</p>
<p>In symbols, an innocuous tyranny is when <span class="math inline">\(d_{v} = d_{u}\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\theta \in \Theta_{M}} \frac{u(\theta, d_{v})}{\norm{\Theta_{M}}} &lt; \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_{m}} \frac{u(\theta, d’)}{\norm{\Theta_{m}}}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_{M}\)</span> is the set of voters in the majority, <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_{m}\)</span> is the set of voters in the minority, and <span class="math inline">\(d’\)</span> is the minority’s preferred outcome.</p>
<p>Obviously, calling this situation innocuous is tendentious and I’m not about run out and slaughter lambs based on this logic. The logic outlined here ignores classic objects to utilitarianism like the ‘separateness of persons’. But I think utilitarians at least would be on board with majority rule in ‘innocuous’ scenario whereas I think zero (?) theories of the good would support the invidious tyranny of the majority.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To summarize, we call it a ‘tyranny of the majority’ when the minority has stronger preferences than the majority which aren’t honored. This tyranny is invidious if allowing the majority to overrule the minority doesn’t maximize aggregate utility. It’s innocuous if allowing the majority to overrule the minority does maximize aggregate utility (i.e. the majority is big enough).</p>

<p>Reductive summary of claims: Positive impacts of direct cash transfers attenuate considerably over time. Negative spillover effects for non-recipients are substantial.</p>
<blockquote>
Comparing recipients households to non-recipients in distant villages, we find that recipients of cash transfers have 40% more assets than control households three years post transfer. This amount (USD 422 PPP) is equivalent to 60% of the initial transfer (USD 709 PPP). However, we do not find statistically significant across-village treatment effects on other outcomes. This difference could stem … from potential spillover effects at the village level. Indeed, non-recipient households in treatment villages show differences to pure control households on several dimensions. The point estimates suggest spillover households spend USD 30 PPP less than pure control households, or about 16% based on a pure control mean of USD 188 PPP, and score ~0.25 SD less on an index of food security than pure control households. Spillover households also score ˜0.18 SD less on an index of psychological wellbeing than pure control households.

<blockquote>
The magnitude of the income gains of the “best you can do” via direct interventions to raise the income of the poor in situ is about 40 times smaller than the income gain from allowing people from those same poor countries to work in a high productivity country like the USA. Simply allowing more labor mobility holds vastly more promise for reducing poverty than anything else on the development agenda.

<p>Overall, I think the essay doesn’t do much to support the titular claim. The closest it gets is a couple paragraphs in the middle stating, “The industry exploits complex, sentient beings as resources, which is a woefully inefficient process.” I’d certainly be interested in hearing a more compelling argument on this topic (i.e. animal welfare arguments that are justified solely in terms of benefits to <em>homo sapiens</em>).

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to most ethical theories, the actions of any AI agent we create have moral import. To accommodate this reality, we guide the agent with a utility function and (implicitly or explicitly) an ethical framework.</p>
<p>One of the key problems of AI alignment is that we are uncertain about which ethical theory to encode in the agent because we (philosophers, humans, society) are ourselves unsure of the correct ethical theory. How can we expect our agent to act in accordance with our values when we don’t even know what our values are?</p>
<p>I propose that we wave the white flag of surrender in the battle to find final, certain answers to the hard problems of ethics. Instead, we should reify our uncertainty and our search procedures in agents we build.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="ethical-surrender">Ethical surrender</h1>
<p>Our prior should be that “solving” ethics is hard: Many smart people have worked on it for centuries. We can also take a step back and allude to more <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/">fundamental limitations to knowledge</a> which suggest a definitive solution to ethics isn’t around the corner.</p>
<p>There is a certain simplicity to the empirical domain. We can see it, taste it, feel it. And yet, the possibility of certain, empirical knowledge has faced strong skepticism from philosophers for centuries (dating at least to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/">David Hume</a>). Do we simplify the problem of induction by moving to the abstracted domain of ethics? I think not.</p>
<p>If induction is out, what about deduction? Again, there are <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/">limits</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this section is brief and handwavey. We’ve sidestepped big, intricate arguments about the nature of ethics and moral epistemology. But I hope it primes your intuition enough that you’re willing to provisionally accept that uncertainty is a major feature of ethics now and in the future.</p>
<h1 id="moral-uncertainty">Moral uncertainty</h1>
<p>Once we accept this uncertainty, we must choose how to respond. If we don’t reflect on the idea of moral uncertainty, our approach is likely to approximate <a href="http://johanegustafsson.net/papers/in-defence-of-my-favourite-theory.pdf">“my favorite theory”</a>. In this approach, we weigh the options, find whichever ethical theory fares best, and discard the rest. That is, if, after analysis, we think the categorical imperative is 20% likely to be true and utilitarianism is 80% likely to be true, we act as utilitarians.</p>
<p>A compelling alternative is to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html">retain our uncertainty and evaluate actions against a weighted parliament of ethical theories</a>. In our 80-20 scenario above, any action is evaluated against both theories. If utilitarianism marginally prefers action B to A while the categorical imperative heavily favors A over B, we do A (even though we are “mostly” utilitarian!).</p>
<h2 id="moral-uncertainty-in-machines">Moral uncertainty in machines</h2>
<p>The impression I have (admittedly, mostly from afar) is that AI alignment has mostly (implicitly) revolved around the “my favorite theory” approach. That is, people have been approaching the issue as deciding which single ethical theory they will encode in an agent. Until they’re certain they’ve decided upon the “one true theory” of ethics, all powerful agents are the stuff of nightmares. I think the parliamentary model improves on this situation.</p>
<p>When encoding the parliamentary model in machines, <span class="noted">there’s good reason to avoid simply transferring our own intuitions and perspectives into the machine</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Instead, the parliament’s initial distribution should probably be set by a <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution">maximum entropy distribution</a></span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> (i.e. each ethical theory starts with equal likelihood). Of course, we can’t leave it there. That would throw away valuable information about the fact of the matter (i.e. what evidence do we have bearing on the relative likelihood of each moral theory to be correct). An abhorrence for discarding information (that is, we objected to “forgetting” our uncertainty and acting as though we’re certain of our favored theory) is precisely what motivated us to choose the parliamentary approach in the first place.</p>
<p>Instead, we will allow and expect our agent to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayesian updates</a> to reweight the moral parliament. That is, in addition to any actions it can take in the world (e.g. an autonomous car turning left, a paperclip factory agent reconfiguring its supply chain. For lack of familiarity with a better term, we’ll call actions-in-the-world “interventions” henceforth), the agent also always has the option of performing ethical investigation (e.g. ). This supposes that we have a workable answer to the questions of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/">moral epistemology</a> and thus a well-founded way to perform these updates. We’ll bracket the question of how exactly this can be done while noting that moral epistemology is at least a different hard problem to solve than the problem which AI alignment typically confronts.</p>
<h3 id="necessity-of-agent-embedding">Necessity of agent embedding</h3>
<p>The above sounds like a generic algorithm for ethical investigation. Why embed it in an agent rather than asking it to run “to completion” and using the result, or creating a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6SGqkCgHuNr7d4yJm/thoughts-on-the-singularity-institute-si">tool AI</a>? Under most plausible moral epistemes, I suspect running “to completion” would be <span class="noted">computationally intractable</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. On the subject of tool AIs, I’ll leave it to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI">Why tool AIs want to be agent AIs</a> and note that foundational ethical investigation seems like a bad place to skimp on capability.</p>
<h1 id="arbitrating-between-interventions-and-investigations">Arbitrating between interventions and investigations</h1>
<p>How should ethical investigation be valued in the agent’s utility function? We must answer this question before our agent can make appropriate trade-offs between intervention and ethical investigation. Once we see the ethical investigation as an information-gathering task, the solution falls out naturally. We should use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information">value of information calculations</a> to value ethical investigation.</p>
<p>Briefly, <span class="noted">value of information</span><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> is a well-founded way of quantifying our intuition that uncertainty has a cost. When our actions result in uncertain outcomes, we muddle through as best we can. But information that reduces the uncertainty associated with an action has a tangible value. It may actually cause us to change our actions and obtain better outcomes. If a decision maker would pay up to $X for this information, then we say it has a value of $X.</p>
<p>In this case, the value in our value of information calculation is determined by our parliament of moral theories. This is circular (and thus a bit confusing), but, I think, can be <span class="noted">made to work</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. So we’d expect our agent to perform ethical investigation only insofar as the information produced by that investigation might affect interventions under consideration (Hence the “lazy” in our title. In particular, we’re appealing to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy evaluation</a>—values (both computational and ethical) ought to be computed only on an as needed basis instead of eagerly and preemptively.) and where the value of that information is greater than any currently available intervention.</p>
<h1 id="claimed-benefits">Claimed benefits</h1>
<h2 id="ai-arms-race">AI arms race</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Racing-to-the-precipice-a-model-of-artificial-intelligence-development.pdf">AI arms race</a>, the naive approach to alignment (First, solve ethics. Then, develop AGI.) puts the most scrupulous developers at a disadvantage. Because the costs of scrupulosity are so high, we expect most developers to end up in the “unscrupulous” category. The lazy approach may offer a significant advantage here. Because the approach is conceptually straightforward, implementation could be relatively manageable. As such, asking all agent creators to include it is a more plausible request than demanding the cessation of all agent development. Furthermore, when an agent finds itself doing trivial actions of no moral import, it can remain fairly disinterested in ethics. Broad approximations of ethical truth suffice. This means agent creators working in certain fields can be fairly confident that the run time costs (e.g. agent performance overhead, constraints on agent actions, agent predictability) are minimal. Again, this makes ethical consideration cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="ambiguity-alignment">Ambiguity alignment</h2>
<p>All the moral conundrums that we humans confront are now moral conundrums for our agent as well. When it is faced with truly difficult and important moral decisions, rather than blithely running ahead, our agent will be prompted to pause and refine its ethical views. We can even imagine moral epistemes in which human intuition is a vital input so our agent would actively seek human advice precisely when we are most afraid of the interventions of alien intelligence.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="predominate" class="arg-map">predominance of capital-managed firms (CMF) over worker cooperatives (WC)</a> remains an open question in economics. Early explanations relied on a hypothesized comparative inefficiency of cooperatives. Subsequent empirical study has shown that <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="efficient" class="arg-map">cooperatives are at least as efficient as capital-managed firms</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="doucouliagos95">(Doucouliagos <a href="#ref-doucouliagos95">1995</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="estrin87">(Estrin, Jones, and Svejnar <a href="#ref-estrin87">1987</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="craig95">(Craig et al. <a href="#ref-craig95">1995</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="levine90">(Levine <a href="#ref-levine90">1990</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A profusion of hypotheses has since arisen. <span class="citation" data-cites="dow99">(Dow and Putterman <a href="#ref-dow99">1999</a>)</span> offers a good summary (though the term must be used loosely for a 126-page paper). One that I have not seen presented is: <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="hypothesis" class="arg-map">capital-managed firms predominate because capitalists have a greater incentive to expand than worker-owners in worker cooperatives</a>. Roughly, for each market segment a capitalist expands into, their income increases by capital’s share of the new segment’s profit. For each market segment a cooperative expands into, the expanders receive no direct remuneration (supposing that the new market segment is also a cooperative). Any new profit goes to worker-owners in the new segment.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1 id="cellular-automaton">Cellular automaton</h1>
<p>We can make this hypothesis more tangible by representing it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a>. <span class="noted"><a href="#cooperatives-map" id="automaton-link" class="arg-map">In this automaton</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="segment" class="arg-map">each cell represents a market segment requiring a fixed quantity of labor and capital</a>. Adjacent cells represent similar market segments.</p>
<div id="automaton">

</div>
<h2 id="initial-conditions">Initial conditions</h2>
<p>In the beginning, the market is filled with <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="empty" class="arg-map">empty market segments which have a random cost</a> (represented in the automaton by the opacity of the <span class="empty">red cell interiors</span>) for a firm to expand into.</p>
<h2 id="step">Step</h2>
<h3 id="occupied-market-segments">Occupied market segments</h3>
<p>In each step, an existing firm may go bankrupt (or exit the market segment in some other way) with fixed probability <span class="math inline">\(B = 0.1\)</span>. If a firm goes bankrupt, its market segment becomes empty once again.</p>
<p>If it does not go bankrupt, <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="accum" class="arg-map">the profits generated during that step are distributed</a>. For worker cooperatives, all profits accrue to the worker-owners within the cooperative. For capital-managed segments, labor’s share of income (estimated at 70% <span class="citation" data-cites="karabarbounis13">(Karabarbounis and Neiman <a href="#ref-karabarbounis13">2013</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="gomme04">(Gomme and Rupert <a href="#ref-gomme04">2004</a>)</span>) accrues to the segment’s workers and capital’s share of income accrues to the capitalists of the segment’s firm.</p>
<p>The accumulated income of workers in a capital-managed segment is represented in the automaton by opacity of the <span class="capital">purple cell interior</span>. The accumulated income of the capitalists (of a given firm) is represented by the opacity of the <span class="capital">purple cell border</span> enclosing all segments owned by the firm. The accumulated income of worker-owners in a worker cooperative is represented in the automaton by the opacity of the <span class="labor">green cell interior</span>. Worker cooperatives sharing an ancestor (e.g. cooperative B and C were both founded by cooperative A) are enclosed by a single border.</p>
<h3 id="empty-market-segments">Empty market segments</h3>
<p>In each step, an empty market segment may be occupied by <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="firm" class="arg-map">a newly formed firm</a> with chance <span class="math inline">\(N = 0.001\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also, in each step, <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="expand" class="arg-map">an empty market segment may be subject to expansion</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">adjacent firms</a>. Each adjacent firm has a 20% chance of attempting expansion (representing market conditions, firm conditions, &amp;c.). The cost of expansion into the market segment must be less than the accumulated income of the expander and less than the projected value of the segment. In the event of multiple firms competing to expand into a single segment, the firm with the greatest valuation for the segment succeeds.</p>
<p>Valuations are determined thus:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Capital-managed firm</dt>
<dd>The total value a capital-management firm can expect to extract from a segment takes the form <span class="math inline">\(KP + KP(1 - B)(1 - D) + KP(1 - B)^2(1 - D)^2 + \ldots\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is capital’s share of income, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the per-step profit, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the bankruptcy rate, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the firm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value">discount rate</a> (ranging uniformly from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>). Using the formula for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula">geometric series</a>, we can write this as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{KP}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)}\)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Worker cooperative</dt>
<dd>Similarly, the total value a worker cooperative can expect to extract from a segment takes the form <span class="math inline">\(\frac{AS}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(S = GP - LP\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the productivity advantage of worker cooperatives (set to 1.1 in the automaton) and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is labor’s share of income, represents the comparative benefit for worker-owners in a worker cooperative over being laborers in a capital-managed firm. <a href="#cooperatives-map" id="altruism" class="arg-map"><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (“altruism”) represents the extent to which the expanding worker cooperative cares about these potential gains.</a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A quick consequence of this model is that worker cooperatives and capital-managed firms will value expansions equally (assuming equal discount and bankruptcy rates) when</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_law">Campbell’s law</a> in action. Because average citation count isn’t what we actually value, when it becomes the metric by which decisions are made, it distorts academic research. In the rest of this post, I propose a bibliometric that measures the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy reduction</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">research graph</a>.</p>

<h1 id="entropy-header">Entropy</h1>
<p>Claude Shannon <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="entropy" class="arg-map">codified entropy</a> as <span class="math inline">\(H(X) = -\sum\limits_{i} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> are the possible values of a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="shannon48">(Shannon <a href="#ref-shannon48">1948</a>)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="cover12">(Cover and Thomas <a href="#ref-cover12">2012</a>)</span>. For example, the entropy of a 6-sided die is <img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/906174370527848253.svg" title="\begin{align}
  H(D) &amp;= - P(⚀) \log_2 P(⚀) - P(⚁) \log_2 P(⚁) - P(⚂) \log_2 P(⚂) \\
       &amp; - P(⚃) \log_2 P(⚃) - P(⚄) \log_2 P(⚄) - P(⚅) \log_2 P(⚅) \\
       &amp;= -\left(6 \left(\frac{1}{6} \log_2 \frac{1}{6}\right)\right) \\
       &amp;= \log_2 6
\end{align}" />.</p>
<p>If we next learn that the die is weighted and can only roll even numbers, this changes the entropy (our uncertainty).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/-6310274088524152858.svg" title="\begin{align}
H(D|\epsilon) &amp;= - P(⚁) \log_2 P(⚁) -

     &amp;= - \left(3 \left(\frac{1}{3} \log_2 \frac{1}{3}\right)\right) \\
     &amp;= \log_2 3
\end{align}" /></p>
<p><span class="noted">So the reduction in uncertainty is <span class="math inline">\(H(D) - H(D|\epsilon) = \log_2 6 - \log_2 3 = 1\)</span>.</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>We can use these definitions to calculate the information provided by a research paper and assign an Infometric®™ score. We’ll start with a fairly classic example about cigarette smoking.</p>
<h2 id="first-study">First study</h2>
<p>Suppose <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="single" class="arg-map">we do a study</a> on whether, in the normal course of smoking, cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs (we’ll call this proposition <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>). Prior to the study we use the (extremely) uninformative prior <span class="math inline">\(\cond{P}{A=t}{} = 0.5\)</span>. After the study (which we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) we perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayesian update</a> and find that <span class="math inline">\(\cond{P}{A=t}{\alpha} = 0.8\)</span>. So our study has provided</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/5273260164788045100.svg" title="\begin{align}
H(A) - \cond{H}{A}{\alpha} &amp;= -P(A=t)\log_2P(A=t) - P(A=f)\log_2P(A=f) \\
  &amp;+ \cond{P}{A=t}{\alpha}\log_2\cond{P}{A=t}{\alpha} \\
  &amp;+ \cond{P}{A=f}{\alpha}\log_2\cond{P}{A=f}{\alpha} \\
  &amp;= -0.5\log_20.5 \\
  &amp;- 0.5\log_20.5 \\
  &amp;+ 0.8\log_20.8 \\
  &amp;+ 0.2\log_20.2 \\
  &amp;\approx 0.278
\end{align}" /></p>
<p>bits of entropy reduction. Thus its score at the moment is <span class="math inline">\(0.278\)</span>. So far, so good?</p>
<h2 id="second-study">Second study</h2>
<p>Now, we wish to study whether smoking causes chronic bronchitis. Suppose the study we design pipes smoke directly into the lungs of experimental subjects. The validity of our conclusion (Smoking does (not) cause chronic bronchitis.) now depends on the truth of the claim that cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs. So this new study is dependent on the prior study and will cite it.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Now we carry out our study. It provides evidence that cigarette smoking does lead to bronchitis (conditional on the supposition that cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs). So we update our <span class="math inline">\(\cond{P}{B=t}{\beta}\)</span>. The entropy reduction from this study, considered in isolation, is <span class="math inline">\(H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} \approx 0.266\)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<p>But what if we don’t consider it in isolation? First, we look for the total entropy reduction from both studies and find <span class="math inline">\(H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} \approx 0.703\)</span>. <span class="noted">Note that this is not simply the sum of the isolated reductions.</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>How do we apportion this gain into Infometric®™ scores then? We can decompose the aggregate gain into a sum like</p>
<p><img src="https://www.col-ex.org/images/latex/1681010744790707563.svg" title="\begin{align}
H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} &amp;=
    \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} \\
  &amp;+ H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta}
\end{align}" /></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} - \cond{H}{A,B}{\alpha,\beta} \approx 0.437\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’s score and <span class="math inline">\(H(A,B) - \cond{H}{A,B}{\beta} \approx 0.266\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s score.</p>
<p>(the general form is <span class="math inline">\(H(S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n) - \cond{H}{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n}{\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\cdots,\sigma_n} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n I(\sigma_i))\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I(\sigma_i) = \cond{H}{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_i}{\sigma_{i+1},\sigma_{i+2},\cdots,\sigma_n} - \cond{H}{S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_i}{\sigma_i,\sigma_{i+1},\sigma_{i+2},\cdots,\sigma_n}\)</span></p>
<p>We can see that <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> citing <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> has increased <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’s score (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> now reduces our uncertainty not only about <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, but also about <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), a “citation bonus”. Or, if you prefer, you can think of it as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> capturing the externalities it generates in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-study">Fourth study</h2>
<p>We’ll now jump to <a href="#bibliometric-map" id="four" class="arg-map">a fourth study</a> so we can examine a fuller set of interactions (i.e. multiples studies citing one study, one study citing multiple studies).</p>

The human race, to which so many of my readers belong, has been playing at children’s games from the beginning…. And one of the games to which it is most attached is called “Keep to-morrow dark,” …. The players listen very carefully and respectfully to all that the clever men have to say about what is to happen in the next generation. The players then wait until all the clever men are dead, and bury them nicely. They then go and do something else. That is all. For a race of simple tastes, however, it is great fun. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="chesterton04">(Chesterton <a href="#ref-chesterton04">1904</a>)</span></span>

<div class="conversation">
<p>“How likely are we to have <a href="https://theinfosphere.org/Holophonor">holophonors</a> by 3002?”</p>
<p>“Pretty likely. They’re pretty much <a href="#futurism-map" id="naive" class="arg-map">just better oboes, right? 80% chance?</a>”</p>
<p>“<a href="#futurism-map" id="overconfident" class="arg-map">Keep in mind the</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect">overconfidence bias</a>.</a>”</p>
<p>“Alright, 70% chance.”</p>
<p>“Also, note that people are pretty bad at predictions. A study by George Wise found that <span class="noted"><a href="#futurism-map" id="mediocre" class="arg-map">out of 1556 naive medium-term predictions made publicly by Americans between 1890 and 1940, just under 40% had been fulfilled or were in progress by 1976</a></span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="wise76">(Wise <a href="#ref-wise76">1976</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Then I won’t just make a reflexive prediction. I’ll give the matter serious thought… Well, <a href="#futurism-map" id="single" class="arg-map">people in the future will probably be really into opera and the arts because shiny, metal robots will do all the real work. So they’ll be sitting on their hover chairs in their spandex togas. And they’ll want to listen to something—but see something at the same time—just like laser light shows. But lasers will be pretty blasé in the future (what with the ubiquitous laser pocket knifes, laser watches, and laser pointers). So holophonors will be the perfect thing. So, I guess a 90% chance of holophonors?</a>”</p>
<p>“Ah ha ha. You fell right into my trap! Your casual futurism betrays you! Just by imagining that scenario, you think it’s more likely.”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“Says who?”</p>
<p>“John Carroll, that’s who. He asked some college students to imagine themselves on election day for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1976">1976 U.S. presidential election</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="carroll78">(Carroll <a href="#ref-carroll78">1978</a>)</span>. <a href="#futurism-map" id="moreLikely" class="arg-map">Some were told to imagine Carter winning. They were significantly more certain that Carter would win than those that didn’t imagine anything.</a>”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe it was a persuasively coherent reverie. My holophonor scenario was pretty airtight. That doesn’t sound so bad to be convinced by an exceptionally plausible scenarios…. Wait, what happened with those told to imagine Ford winning?”</p>
<p>“I think you can guess. They became more certain that Ford would win. He got pretty similar results when he asked students to predict the success of the University of Pittsburgh’s football team after having some of the students imagine a good season and some imagine a bad season. Carroll concluded, ‘The objective fact that some events are imaginary, hypothetical, inferred rather than observed … is poorly coded or not properly used. Thus, the act of posing a problem or asking a question could itself change the beliefs of subjects.’”</p>
<p>“It could be worse. I could believe in something absurd—like a future with no holophonors. Out of all possible scenarios, I described the most plausible.”</p>
<p>“Nope. <a href="#futurism-map" id="optimistic" class="arg-map">People’s default, ‘realistic’ predictions are pretty much just their most optimistic predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="buehler94">(Buehler, Griffin, and Ross <a href="#ref-buehler94">1994</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="newby00">(Newby-Clark et al. <a href="#ref-newby00">2000</a>)</span>.</a>”</p>
<p>“But how common is this problem? It seems like you just tricked me into a vivid visualization.”</p>
<p>“Not so much. Constructing details and filling in gaps is an almost inevitable part of any serious prediction effort <span class="citation" data-cites="griffin90">(Griffin, Dunning, and Ross <a href="#ref-griffin90">1990</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“Alright, you smug snake. I give up. I can’t just reflexively shout out a number and trying to think about the prediction in detail only makes matters worse. What should I do then? How do I see into the future?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’m not sure. Since naive methods seem to fare so dismally, we should probably use some sort of system. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of empirical evidence on effective forecasting techniques.”</p>
<p>“Presumably we want to minimize all these biases, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. There a lot of techniques to choose from though <span class="citation" data-cites="tag04">(Group <a href="#ref-tag04">2004</a>)</span>. Since we’re just a couple of schlemiels, we can’t really call up a panel of experts for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method">Delphi method</a>. And for a lot of the mathematical models, ‘even the relevant variables are not known, let alone the linkages between the variables.’ <span class="citation" data-cites="martino03">(Martino <a href="#ref-martino03">2003</a>)</span> If we feel we must forecast, the best general-purpose technique might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning">scenario planning</a>.”</p>
<p>“I thought you just got done scolding me for scenarios!”</p>
<p>“I did. But the distinguishing feature of scenario planning (a term of art) is a semi-rigorized approach to <a href="#futurism-map" id="multiple" class="arg-map">generating fundamentally divergent, coherent narratives of the future.</a> Proponents suggest the consideration of multiple scenarios is salubrious.”</p>
<p>“Are they right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. As I lamented already, evidence is sparse. And a lot of that evidence relies on self-report about the decision process. ‘Since [decision] outcome is often difficult to evaluate the … process perspective has become the major stream of research on decision quality.’ <span class="citation" data-cites="meissner13">(Meissner and Wulf <a href="#ref-meissner13">2013</a>)</span>”</p>
<p>“That sounds problematic, since your major contention is the dominating role of bias.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. But the outcome evidence that exists does seem to suggest that scenario planning is a bit better than naive methods. Whether it’s actually satisfactory…”</p>
<p>“Good news first. What’s the evidence in favor of scenario planning?”</p>
<p>“The most direct evidence of outcome efficacy comes from three researchers at the University of Surrey <span class="citation" data-cites="phelps01">(Phelps, Chan, and Kapsalis <a href="#ref-phelps01">2001</a>)</span>. They performed an observational study of information technology companies in the UK. After sampling, they looked at 50 companies using scenario planning and 50 that didn’t. <a href="#futurism-map" id="outcomes" class="arg-map">The companies using scenario planning showed significantly greater growth in profits and return on capital employed,</a> though they did not show significantly greater growth in clients. They did a similar study with 22 water companies. Here, there was no significant relationship between scenario planning and the performance variables.”</p>
<p>“Hm. What’s the other ‘favorable’ evidence?”</p>
<p>“In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design">repeated measures study</a>, researchers found that <a href="#futurism-map" id="widened" class="arg-map">scenario planning widened 50% and 90% confidence intervals on personally important strategic measures</a> by 56% and 44% respectively <span class="citation" data-cites="schoemaker93">(Schoemaker <a href="#ref-schoemaker93">1993</a>)</span>. However, they also found that <a href="#futurism-map" id="narrowed" class="arg-map">when asked to construct extreme scenarios (judged as implausible), ranges actually contracted.</a>”</p>
<p>“So whether scenario planning increases or decreases confidence intervals depends on which scenarios are constructed.”</p>
<p>“Yep. In an experimental study of graduate management students planning for a case company, <a href="#futurism-map" id="framing" class="arg-map">students who went through a full scenario planning process showed no evidence of the</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)">framing bias</a></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="meissner13">(Meissner and Wulf <a href="#ref-meissner13">2013</a>)</span>. Students that went through only the initial part of the scenario process, but didn’t actually generate scenarios, still showed susceptibility to the framing bias. However, students that used <a href="#futurism-map" id="other" class="arg-map">traditional strategic planning tools</a> (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_five_forces_analysis">Porter’s five forces</a>) were also effectively debiased. Other researchers even suggest that directions akin to ‘think harder’ are sufficient to defeat the framing bias <span class="citation" data-cites="wright02">(Wright and Goodwin <a href="#ref-wright02">2002</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“What else?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty much all I could muster in favor of scenario planning. Of pretty fundamental concern for scenario planning is evidence that generating multiple scenarios doesn’t alter point predictions. Researchers did a study in which they asked university students to estimate when they’d complete school assignments and then followed-up to determine the actual completion times <span class="citation" data-cites="newby00">(Newby-Clark et al. <a href="#ref-newby00">2000</a>)</span>. Through a variety of experimental permutations, they concluded that, ‘<a href="#futurism-map" id="pessimistic" class="arg-map">Participants’ final task completion time estimates were not affected when they generated pessimistic scenarios … in combination with more optimistic scenarios.</a> … [R]egardless of plausibility, predictors did not attend to pessimistic scenarios.’ Similar results were found by Paul Schoemaker <span class="citation" data-cites="schoemaker92">(Schoemaker and Heijden <a href="#ref-schoemaker92">1992</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“Any more?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A quasi-experimental study of managers found that <a href="#futurism-map" id="rational" class="arg-map">scenario planning decreased rational decision-making and increased intuitive decision-making</a> as measured by the General Decision-Making Style Survey <span class="citation" data-cites="chermack08">(Chermack and Nimon <a href="#ref-chermack08">2008</a>)</span>.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like it could be conducive to biases.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Ronald Bradfield offers a pretty harsh indictment of scenario planning <span class="citation" data-cites="bradfield08">(Bradfield <a href="#ref-bradfield08">2008</a>)</span>. He observed five groups of five or six postgraduate students developing scenarios for a designated organization. He observed that, for each group, their starting point determined which factors were subsequently explored in scenarios and this starting point was essentially determined by events highly publicized in the media like avian influenza and stem cell research. When countervailing evidence was introduced or alternate developments were suggested, the groups generally discarded them, returning to a ‘common … midpoint of events that were expected to occur’. Bradfield concluded that ‘there was no evidence of the so-called out of the box thinking in the scenarios and there were no strategic insights as to how the future might evolve in new and unprecedented ways’.”</p>
<p>“Is that everything?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty much all the useful information I could find.”</p>
<p>“So where does that leave us?”</p>
<p>“I’m not totally sure. Schoemaker concluded that, ‘Scenarios thus exploit one set of biases (such as the conjunction fallacy and intransitivities of beliefs) to overcome another set, namely overconfidence, anchoring and availability biases.’ <span class="citation" data-cites="schoemaker93">(Schoemaker <a href="#ref-schoemaker93">1993</a>)</span>. Ultimately, scenario planning may be one of the less bad prediction methods.”</p>

<p>When teaching something, is it best to start with concrete and move to the abstract? Or is it best to emphasize the abstract and introduce concrete applications later? Research on this topic is ambivalent <span class="citation" data-cites="flores09">(Flores <a href="#ref-flores09">2009</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="debock11">(De Bock et al. <a href="#ref-debock11">2011</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="kaminski08">(Kaminski, Sloutsky, and Heckler <a href="#ref-kaminski08">2008</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="peterson88">(Peterson, Mercer, and O’Shea <a href="#ref-peterson88">1988</a>)</span>. It’s conceivable that the superior approach depends on the student. With one-on-one in-person instruction, this sort of adaptation is possible. With traditional, static text, it’s not. On the web (with computers generally), it is.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For example (Click one of the arrows on the side to swap the order.):</p>
<p>For each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">natural number</a>, addition with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> produces the same number. For each natural number, multiplication with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> produces the same number.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid">monoid</a> is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element.</p>
<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<p>Now suppose that we wish to make some argument which holds, as a premise, that the state is just and necessary. Because it is not the core of our argument, any argument which convinces the reader to accept that premise suffices. Instead of presenting many arguments equally in the text and implicitly asking the reader to choose, we can make that choice explicit.</p>
<p>For example (Click the highlighted region to bring up a menu. Click one of the options in the menu to activate that choice.):</p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="state">
<div class="open">
<p>The state is a “framework … needed to simplify the application of the two principles of justice”:</p>
<blockquote>
First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others. Second: social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) reasonably expected to be to everyone’s advantage, and (b) attached to positions and offices open to all. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="rawls09">(Rawls <a href="#ref-rawls09">2009</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>(these principles justified by the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/">original position</a>.)</p>

<p>This technique can be found <em>in vivo</em> in <a href="https://www.col-ex.org/posts/quorum/">the post on quorum</a> (which also demonstrates synchronized choice i.e. changing what needs to be changed in subsequent sections to congrue with early choices).</p>

<p>The common element here is that these tools allow for more dialogic text. Instead of fixing one canonical version of the text, we can now, in a limited way, respond to the reader’s preferences.</p>
<p>An alternate view is that these tools allow us to express the structure of our argument with greater fidelity. Traditional text enforces linearity. Structural aspects must be described within the text itself, mixing levels (i.e. we have text which provides the content of our argument interspersed with text which describes the structure of our argument). A standard grammar here could increase both parsimony and efficacy. Viewing the structure of an argument as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a> permits a visualization of the tools described above:</p>

<p>Pie Club is voting on which pie will be featured at their first August meeting. <span class="noted">After tallying the votes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buko_pie">buko pie</a> receives a mean score of <span class="math inline">\(0.69\)</span> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_pie">fish pie</a> receives a mean score of <span class="math inline">\(0.18\)</span>.</span><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
Before the decision is finalized, however, an observant member notices that the meeting is <a href="#quorum-map" id="restrictive" class="arg-map">two members short of the 25 required for quorum</a>.

<blockquote>
<a href="#quorum-map" id="quorum-def" class="arg-map">The minimum number of members who must be present at the meetings</a> of a deliberative assembly for business to be validly transacted is the <em>quorum</em> of the assembly.

<p>So quorum is a proxy for representativeness. But as the examples demonstrate, it’s, at best, a loose proxy. Sometimes (as in the <a href="#example1">first example</a>) quorum is too demanding—it forbids a decision when the votes endorse one. On other occasions (as in the <a href="#example2">second example</a>), quorum is too lax—it declares representativeness when there can be no certainty of it.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative then? How do we determine if a vote is representative? Statistics!</p>

<p>For each pair of alternatives, we’d like to find which of these three is true:</p>

<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \gg \mu_2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \approx \mu_1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x \gg y\)</span> means something like “We are justified in believing that <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y\)</span>.” and <span class="math inline">\(x \approx y\)</span> means something like “We aren’t justified in believing that <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y\)</span> or that <span class="math inline">\(y &gt; x\)</span>.”. The first two correspond to quorum and the third corresponds to a failure of quorum.</p>
<p>To establish <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span>, we construct a lower <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credible bound (a one-sided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval">credible interval</a>)</span></span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 - \mu_1\)</span> base on our votes. The lower bound delimits the region where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 - \mu_1\)</span> is largest. If the delimited region includes <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, we must reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span> (i.e. if the region most favorable to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> still doesn’t exclude <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, we aren’t justified in believing <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 &gt; \mu_1\)</span> (at the chosen <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credibility</span></span> level)).</p>
<p>The approach for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \gg \mu_2\)</span> is similar (simply swap in an upper bound or <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>If we reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \gg \mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 \gg \mu_2\)</span>, we must accept <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 \approx \mu_1\)</span> and declare a failure of quorum.</p>
<p>For example, we’d like to <a href="#quorum-map" id="bayes" class="arg-map">determine if the <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credible</span></span> bounds support the conclusion</a> that buko pie really is preferred to fish pie. If Pie Club bylaws specified a <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> <span class="inline switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type"><span class="open">credible</span></span> bound and the lower bound for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{buko} - \mu_{fish}\)</span> stretched to <span class="math inline">\(0.359\)</span> while the upper bound stretched to <span class="math inline">\(0.58\)</span>, we’d declare that quorum had been reached in favor of buko pie. (We reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{fish} \gg \mu_{buko}\)</span> because it’s bounded region includes <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We can’t reject <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{buko} \gg \mu_{fish}\)</span> because it’s bounded region excludes <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.) Alternately, if the lower bound stretched to <span class="math inline">\(-0.1\)</span> and the upper bound stretched to <span class="math inline">\(0.58\)</span>, we’d declare a failure of quorum.</p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<p>How do we construct these credible bounds? We derive them from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability">posterior probability distribution</a> created using Bayesian parameter estimation <span class="citation" data-cites="kruschke13">(Kruschke <a href="#ref-kruschke13">2013</a>)</span>. To construct this posterior, we start by specifying <span class="noted">a model for the distribution of paired differences</span><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Because the difference can only take on values in the interval <span class="math inline">\(\left(-1, 1\right)\)</span>, the (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-scale_family">transformed</a> from <span class="math inline">\((0, 1)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((-1, 1)\)</span>) <span class="noted"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">beta distribution</a> is a sensible choice</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. To get a sense of the beta distribution, you can look at the calculator <a href="http://keisan.casio.com/has10/SpecExec.cgi?id=system/2006/1180573226">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a model of differences, we must choose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">prior probability distributions</a> for its parameters. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \beta = 1\)</span> collapses the beta distribution to the uniform distribution. Because the uniform distribution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution">maximum entropy distribution</a> on a supported interval, we should choose prior distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> with means of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="sivia06">(Sivia and Skilling <a href="#ref-sivia06">2006</a>)</span>. The maximum entropy distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> supported on <span class="math inline">\(\left(0, \infty\right)\)</span> is the exponential distribution with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 1\)</span>. So the prior on each of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Exp(1)\)</span>. All of this is diagrammatically represented in the accompanying figure.</p>

That beta distribution’s parameters have priors of \(Exp(1)\)." /><figcaption>We model the vote differences with a beta distribution. That beta distribution’s parameters have priors of <span class="math inline">\(Exp(1)\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now that we have our data and prior probability distributions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayes’ theorem</a> allows us to reallocate probability mass to form the posterior probability distributions. We generate numerical estimates of the posterior probability distributions using adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs <span class="citation" data-cites="roberts09">(Roberts and Rosenthal <a href="#ref-roberts09">2009</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="sumsar-best">(Bååth <a href="#ref-sumsar-best">2012</a>)</span>. These posteriors on the parameters of beta allow us to straightforwardly calculate the posterior on the mean of the difference using the formula for the mean of a beta distribution.</p>

<p><span class="noted">You can try it out below</span><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Maybe look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scenario in which the quorum status (achieved or failed) depends on the credibility level chosen (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(99\%\)</span>)</li>
<li>Two scenarios in which each alternative retains its mean score, but the quorum status changes</li>
<li>Two scenarios in which the number of voters remains the same, but the quorum status changes</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<p>We’ve tacitly <a href="#quorum-map" id="random" class="arg-map">assumed that our actual voters are a random sample</a> of the population of potential voters. This is false (Though one could make it true through adoption of appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition">voting procedures</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias">Self-selection bias</a>, whether due to differential interest, availability, transportation, &amp;c., means that the sample is non-representative. However, the problem of non-random samples also applies to traditional quorum’s assurances of representativeness.</p>
<p>The procedure also accepts the claim of <span class="citation" data-cites="ronr">(Robert, Honemann, and Balch <a href="#ref-ronr">2011</a>)</span> that the purpose of quorum is to ensure representativeness. In consequence, the procedure takes votes as exogenous and characterizes only the resulting information. But one could support quorum for its deliberative, community-building, or even obstructive effects.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="#quorum-map" id="complicated" class="arg-map">isn’t all this math a bit forbidding?</a></p>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<p>The conclusions have a rather intuitive interpretation in terms of likelihood, maybe even more intuitive than the traditional quorum interpretation (“We ensure that our decisions are representative by requiring 25% of our members to attend.”). But getting to the conclusions requires a computer and uncommon math.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So this procedure is less accessible than traditional quorum. How much less depends on the relative importances placed on accessible conclusions and accessible process.</p>
<p>Because this calculation is less accessible and will likely be performed by one or a few individuals, it’s import to establish a clear and strict procedure. We should not permit, for example, the choice of modeling distribution after exploratory data analysis. The more degrees of freedom we give the analyst, the more power we give them to influence results <span class="citation" data-cites="simmons11">(Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn <a href="#ref-simmons11">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, this procedure <a href="#quorum-map" id="post-hoc" class="arg-map">admits only post-hoc declarations of quorum</a>. With the traditional procedure, we can just take attendance at a meeting and determine the quorum status for every referendum therein. With the new procedure, after tallying the votes on an issue, we have to run the quorum calculation to retroactively determine quorum if we achieved quorum.</p>
<h1 id="extended-procedures">Extended procedures</h1>
<div class="switch" type="menu" data-menu="stat-type">
<div class="open">
<h2 id="non-parametric">Non-parametric</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the procedure specified above assumes that the paired differences are amenable to modelling by a beta distribution. This leads to overconfident inferences <span class="citation" data-cites="hoeting99">(Hoeting et al. <a href="#ref-hoeting99">1999</a>)</span>. The assumption can be relaxed through the use of Bayesian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics">non-parametric</a> methods <span class="citation" data-cites="walker99">(Walker et al. <a href="#ref-walker99">1999</a>)</span>. The idea is to use a model with an infinite number of parameters and marginalize out surplus dimensions on our finite data.</p>
<h2 id="tying">Tying</h2>
<p>We can also modify the procedure to permit tying. Under standing voting procedures, scores of <span class="math inline">\(0.490\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.488\)</span> produce an identical outcome ( i.e. victory for the first option) to scores of <span class="math inline">\(0.82\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span>. However, if those values are accurate estimates of the population scores (i.e. the uncertainty is small), one could argue that the former scenario suggests a compromise or synthesis position.</p>
<p>By defining “regions of practical equivalence”, parameter estimation allows the possibility of a tie <span class="citation" data-cites="kruschke13">(Kruschke <a href="#ref-kruschke13">2013</a>)</span>. For example, Pie Club could decide that a difference of mean scores smaller than 0.01 counts as a tie. If the credible interval on the difference of means is contained entirely in this region, we don’t have a failure of quorum (uncertainy about which option is preferred), but certainty that neither option is substantially preferred.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-alternatives">Multiple alternatives</h2>
<p>For simplicity, we looked at referenda with only two alternatives. We can extend the procedure to referenda with more alternatives. The most straightforward method would be to apply the procedure described above pairwise. The credibility level would need to adjusted by something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0id%C3%A1k_correction">Šidák correction</a> to deal with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem">problem of multiple comparisons</a>. A better solution would be to perform a Bayesian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance">ANOVA</a> analogue with follow-up tests <span class="citation" data-cites="wetzels12">(Wetzels, Grasman, and Wagenmakers <a href="#ref-wetzels12">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="non-ordinal-outcomes">Non-ordinal outcomes</h2>
<p>The procedure described above applies to ordinal outcomes. That is, we were looking for the alternative with a score higher than all others. If we are trying to assess outcomes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement">a ratio or interval scale</a>, we’d have to use a different procedure.</p>
<p>The appropriate modification depends on the issue at hand. In cases where caution is required, an organization could dispense with quorum and simply use the conservative bound. In other circumstances, an organization could place limits on the maximum size of the interval.</p>
<p>For example, suppose Pie Club put the size of its budget for the next year to a vote. If it were feeling fiscally responsible, it could simply sets its budget to the <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> lower bound on the mean vote. An alternative would be to declare a failure of quorum if the vote didn’t produce a <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> interval smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\mu \pm 10\%\)</span>.</p>
