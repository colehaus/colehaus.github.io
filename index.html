         <div class="abstract"><p>Donor lotteries are a way for small donors to pool their funds in the hopes that economies of scale will make them more effective. Some people worry about whether others in the lottery are aligned. A parable about a donor lottery with devil illustrates that we should be willing to enter donor lotteries with those opposed to us as long as they have smaller economies of scale.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="donor-lotteries">Donor lotteries</h3>
<p>Effective altruists have proposed and promoted <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14d/donor_lotteries_demonstration_and_faq/">donor lotteries</a>. Briefly, in a donor lottery, donors pool money for charitable contribution. They’re given lottery tickets in proportion to their contributions. The winner of the lottery gets to decide where the pool of charitable funds should be donated. For example, two people each set aside $1,000 for charitable contribution. They then make an agreement and the winner of the coin flip gets to donate the whole $2,000 to the charity of their choosing.</p>
<p>The primary claimed advantage to these lotteries is economies of scale. It probably doesn’t make sense to spend 100 hours picking the absolutely perfect charity when you’re only disbursing $1000 as a solo donor. It probably does make sense to spend the time to make the decision carefully when disbursing $100,000 as the winner of a donor lottery. Other economies of scale include things like: improved chance of response when asking charities for more information, can fund projects with threshold cost (i.e. we can’t even start the project unless we receive at least $XX,000 dollars).</p>
<h3 id="a-common-concern">A common concern</h3>
<p>Though the original proposals all highlight that the primary benefit of donor lotteries is economies of scale, I’ve heard many in the EA community concerned about alignment of other donors: “What if I don’t trust others in the lottery to do thorough research?” “What if others in the lottery prioritize different cause areas?”</p>
<p>Though early advocates address these concerns briefly, subsequent discussions suggests it might be useful to address these concerns more vividly.</p>
<h3 id="donor-lottery-with-the-devil">Donor lottery with the devil</h3>
<p>I contend you should be willing to enter a donor lottery with the devil (this is the weirdly honorable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil">Faustian</a> devil that respects all his compacts). To see this, we just proceed systematically.</p>
<p>Suppose you and the devil each contribute $10,000 dollars. This is your life savings while the devil merely tosses in a carbuncular carbuncle from his pit of gems and anguish. You flip a fair coin.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>There’s not a lot of high quality evidence, but it seems plausible to the author that the putting-out system was better for workers than the factory system and that most gig workers would prefer more standard employment.</p></div>
       

        <blockquote class="epigraph">
They have driven us away from our houses and gardens to work as prisoners in their factories and their seminaries of vice. <span class="attribution">Thomas Exell, 1838</span>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p><a href="./posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/">Last time</a> we reviewed the putting out system—a pre-industrial system of manufacture used in England where workers would take intermediate products home, refine them in some way, and return them to a merchant so that some other worker could perform the next step in the production process. Then, I suggested that this system sounds a lot like the modern gig economy.</p>
<p>Which left us with the question: Why is the gig economy worse than regular, full-time employment (for workers), but putting-out was better than factories (for workers)? We can resolve this tension by either finding that contemporary praise of the putting out system is wrong, finding that criticism of the gig economy is wrong, or (hint, hint) highlighting the disanalogies between the systems.</p>
<h3 id="was-putting-out-actually-preferred-to-factories">Was putting-out actually preferred to factories?</h3>
<h4 id="direct-evidence">Direct evidence</h4>
<p>Obviously, we can’t answer this question definitively and our <span class="noted">direct evidence</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is weak. One piece of direct evidence we do have is contemporary complaints about the factory system like that in the epigraph. Of course, these are only anecdotes and it’s hard to generalize or be sure they’re representative, but, try as I might, I couldn’t find any anecdotes on the other side of the issue—there were no early factory workers singing praises of child labor and 14 hour days.</p>
<p>Another piece of information which tends to reveal preferences is: “[W]here alternatives to factory employment were available, there is evidence that workers flocked to them. […] [D]espite the abysmally low level to which wages fell [in the non-factory cotton weaving industry], a force of domestic cotton weavers numbering some 250,000 survived well into the nineteenth century.” <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> It is, of course, impossible to be certain that worker aversion to factories is what drove this behavior.</p>

<p>Ethics is fundamentally about ‘ought’. What ought we to do? Which actions are proscribed and which prescribed? Among all available actions, which should we actually pursue? I think we can formalize this basic understanding and draw some interesting conclusions.</p>
<p>For any given ethical decision, we have some nonempty set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> (depending on how we individuate, possibly infinite) of possible actions.

That is, an ethical theory is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function">choice function</a> over nonempty sets of actions.</p>
<p>In the rest of the post, we’ll discuss what properties such an ethical choice function might have and build up an understanding of how the tools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order theory</a> might be applied to metaethical reasoning.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>The von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem lets us turn an ordinal utility function into a cardinal utility function. Here, we have an interactive widget that actually constructs a utility function from a series of questions using the theorem.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="von-neumannmorgenstern-utility-theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</a> says that, “under certain axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he or she is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future”. But the somewhat sloppy way I like to think of it is this: If a person has merely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility">ordinal preferences</a> (e.g. I prefer an apple to a banana but can’t or won’t quantify the magnitude of that preference. The preceding information alone isn’t enough to conclude how I’d feel about one apple vs. two bananas.) and reasons well under uncertainty, we can transform those ordinal preferences into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility function</a> (e.g. I like apples exactly twice as much as bananas and would be indifferent between an apple and two bananas (ignoring diminishing marginal utility for the same of exposition).).</p>
<p>This transformation is often useful because a cardinal utility function is much richer and more informative than an ordinal utility function. The extra information is useful, for example, in sidestepping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s impossibility theorem</a> (which says that it’s impossible to have a good voting system if you only ask people for their ordering of candidates).</p>
<h3 id="interactive-vnm">Interactive VNM</h3>
<p>The standard descriptions of the mechanism of the VNM utility theorem may be a little opaque. But because the theorem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof">constructive</a>, we can actually give people a feel for it by putting them ‘inside’ the mechanism and showing them the result. That’s what we attempt here.</p>
<p>In the first text area, enter a list of goods (each on a separate line) for which you’d like to generate a utility function. It starts with a few sample goods, but you’re free to add, remove or otherwise alter these.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided upon the goods you’re interested in, you can proceed to the next step. Here, you’ll be presented with a series of lotteries. In each lottery, you have to decide whether you prefer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> lottery tickets for one good over <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> lottery tickets for the other good, or if you’re indifferent. If your lottery ticket is drawn, you win whatever good is on the ticket. You can register your answer as to which set of tickets you prefer by clicking on one of the three blue boxes.</p>
<p>For example, if you mildly prefer bananas to carrots, you’d click on the banana box when presented with one lottery ticket for each. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot, by your lights (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>). On the other hand (because your preference was only mild), you’d click on the carrot box if offered 100 carrot tickets vs. 1 banana ticket. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 101\)</span>).</p>
<p>After you’ve repeated this process enough, we can deduce what your favorite good of all the listed goods is. With this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire">numéraire</a>, we can start to visualize your utility function and do so with a chart that appears at the bottom. But, of course, we still have uncertainty about the relative value of these goods. Based on the questions you answer, we know upper and lower bounds for your value (a carrot is better than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100}\)</span> banana but worse than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1}\)</span> banana). Over time, by answering more questions, we can refine these intervals until they’re arbitrarily small.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>We use the concept of Pareto improvement to motivate and illustrate partial and total orders.</p></div>
       

        <p>We covered the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto improvement</a> in the <a href="./posts/pareto-examples/">preceding post</a>. I briefly alluded to the fact that it’s a strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial order</a>. Let’s explore that a bit more.</p>
<h3 id="partial-order">Partial order</h3>
<p>A strict partial order is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">binary relation</a> that is irreflexive (no element precedes itself), and transitive. Pareto improvement satisfies both of these criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Irreflexive: <span class="math inline">\(\neg (A \prec A)\)</span></dt>
<dd>No scenario is a Pareto improvement over itself because no one strictly prefers it (person 1 doesn’t prefer scenario A to scenario A), trivially.

<dd>If arbitrary scenario B is a Pareto improvement over arbitrary scenario A and arbitrary scenario C is a Pareto improvement over scenario B, then scenario C is a Pareto improvement over scenario A. In other words, if no one is worse off in scenario B than scenario A and no one is worse off in scenario C than scenario B, then, clearly, no one is worse off in scenario three than scenario A. And if at least one person is better off in scenario B than scenario A and at least one person is better off in scenario C than scenario B, then, clearly, at least one person is better off in scenario C than scenario A.

         <div class="abstract"><p>The putting-out system was a pre-industrial way of organizing work. It involved workers performing small, discrete stages of work in their own homes as merchants coordinated this work across many such households. The subsequent transition to factory labor was detrimental in many ways and is decried by leftists. But the preferred putting-out system seems quite similar to the gig economy which is <em>also</em> poo-pooed by leftists.</p></div>

<h3 id="putting-out-system">Putting-out system</h3>
<p>Between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild#Fall_of_the_guilds">guild system</a> and the full steam <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, England briefly used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putting-out_system">putting-out system</a>. Under this system, finished goods were assembled not in factories or dedicated workshops, but component-by-component in a multitude of homes and cottages.</p>
<p>For example (illustrative hypothetical based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing_by_pre-industrial_methods">Wikipedia</a>): One worker would trundle their hand cart to the market, drop off cleaned wool in exchange for a piece rate payment, and the merchant would dispatch them with a new load of wool. That merchant would take this cleaned wool and give it to another independent worker for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding">carding</a>. The carder would take the cleaned wool home, the family would process it in their home, and then return to the market in a couple weeks to give the merchant carded wool. This staged process would repeat with a separate family taking home loads of inputs and returning outputs for each subsequent stage in the process—spinning, plying, weaving, etc. When the final task was complete, the merchant would take the finished goods to a market or store and sell them to consumers. In this way, the task was broken down into small components and coordinated by the merchants—somewhat like a (spatially and temporally) disaggregated assembly line.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of time reading. But I’m not actually reading very quickly. The typical educated adult reads at about 200 to 400 <abbr title="words per minute">wpm</abbr> (for context, a speaking rate of 150 to 160 <abbr title="words per minute">wpm</abbr> is comfortable). Given that, it seems <em>possible</em> that a better understanding of reading could help me spend that time better. So I read <span class="citation" data-cites="rayner2016">(Rayner et al. <a href="#ref-rayner2016">2016</a>)</span>. Spoiler: It didn’t transform the way I read (and reaffirmed that speed reading is rather less than advocates claim), but it was definitely interesting. The regurgitation that follows focuses more on the article’s description of the ‘how’ of reading and less on the debunking of speed reading.</p>

<h3 id="speech-writing">Speech &gt; writing</h3>
<p>Speech is prior to writing. Spoken language is thought to have originated around 100,000 years ago; written language 5,000 years ago. All human societies have spoken language; not so for writing. No natural language is purely written. Children learn to speak and interpret language without explicit instruction; not so for reading. Thus, we reach the claim that reading and writing is an “optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on” <span class="citation" data-cites="mcguinness1997">(McGuinness <a href="#ref-mcguinness1997">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>After this bolting is complete, many of our reading processes are still mediated by our more fundamental spoken language processes—even during silent reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, when researches asked silent readers to rapidly decide whether words belonged to a category, homophones produced incorrect “yes”es 19% of the time (whether “meet” belongs in the category food) compared to the base rate for orthographically similar words of 3% (<span class="noted">whether “melt” belongs in the category food</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>). The implication here is that we have difficulty translating directly from visual input to units of meaning and this visual-meaning connection is often mediated by the auditory representation.</p></li>
<li><p>In a different study, researchers asked readers to repeat an irrelevant word or phrase aloud while reading in an effort to impede any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization">subvocalization</a>. These readers performed worse on a subsequent test of comprehension than those asked to repeat a sequence of finger taps.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So our brains aren’t great at reading. But neither are our eyes.</p>

<h4 id="equality">Equality</h4>
<p><span class="noted">Our moral intuition</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> easily suggests that equality has moral value. The world in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe_economy">Robinson Crusoe and Friday</a> share coconuts seems vastly better than the world in which Crusoe sits on his coconut throne and doles out the barest sustenance to Friday. It is easy to leap from this intuition to the conclusion that equality is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value">intrinsic</a> good. But, in this post, let’s make a stop at the proposition that equality is instead only an instrumental good.</p>
<h4 id="equality-instrumentally">Equality instrumentally</h4>
<p>If our sole intrinsic good is something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utils</a>, we will still often prefer equality to inequality. What sorcery could introduce such deontological concepts into our consequentialist paradise? The incantation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility">“diminishing marginal utility”</a>. It is an empirical proposition (and mostly fact) that humans do not enjoy their 10th print copy of even their favorite book as much as the first. Thus, a bibliomaniac can improve overall well-being by sharing the love. Losing copy 10 hurts less than gaining copy 1 helps.</p>

<p>We can start to build a visual intuition for this instrumental egalitarianism. Suppose we have an income distribution that looks like this:</p>
