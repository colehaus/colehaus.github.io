        <p><a href="./posts/dominated-decisions/">Last time</a>, we introduced the basic setup of decision theory and examined the dominance decision rule. We also emphasized that the dominance decision rule is “weak” because it applies in very general settings with limited information to go on.</p>
<p>This time, we’ll look at other decision rules that apply in a very minimal setting.</p>
<h3 id="maximin">Maximin</h3>
<p>The first such decision rule is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">maximin</a>.</p>
<h4 id="prose">Prose</h4>
<p>Maximin suggests that in any decision scenario, we look to the worst outcome that may come to pass under each plan of action. We should then pick the action which has the best such outcome. That is, we pick the action with the best worst case—maximize our minimum.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>You have the choice of two alternative routes to work. In good conditions, the first route takes 10 minutes and the second route 5 minutes. But the second route is prone to traffic and on bad days takes 20 minutes while the first route still takes 10 minutes. With a scenario like this, the maximin rule demands that you take the first route since its worst case is only 10 minutes while the second route’s worst case is 20 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="peterson2017introduction">(Peterson <a href="#ref-peterson2017introduction">2017</a>)</span> points out that we can represent decisions with decision matrices. For example, when considering the purchase of home insurance, we have:</p>

</figure>
<p>Each row (after the first) represents a different action and each column (after the first) represents a different possible state of the world. Their intersections—the four cells that are the combination of an act and a world state—are called outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="sets-of-settings">Sets of settings</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">decision theory</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory">social choice theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design">mechanism design</a>, etc.), when presented with a decision, it’s often useful to start by taking stock of what information we have available and what information we would like but don’t have. Depending on the result of this assessment, we will have better or worse strategies available. That is, we’d like to determine the best strategy or solution given the information available. And are there better strategies that we could execute with more information? What is that information? For example, we approach the question of “Should we buy home insurance?” very differently if we know the precise chance of our house catching on fire. Without key information like that, we have to resort to second-best strategies.</p>
<h3 id="dominance">Dominance</h3>
<p>The decision matrix we depicted above reflects one of the <span class="noted">simplest possible</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> settings. In particular, we don’t have any probabilities associated with the different states of the world (“Fire” or “No fire”) which makes it a “decision under ignorance”. Another key limitation is that we don’t have a number representing how good or bad each outcome is—that is, our outcomes have not been assigned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility</a>.</p>
<p>Because this setting is so minimal, it both has wide applicability—it makes very few assumptions that can be contradicted by facts on the ground—and limited insight—the best you can do with minimal information still isn’t very good.</p>

<p>Housing prices in some cities in China have increased more than tenfold in the past decade. They appear to be rising too fast relative to the growth of income.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Due in part to the one-child policy, there were 120 Chinese men for every 100 Chinese women as of 2005—in some provinces this ratio is as high as 130 to 100. […] One of the most visible symbols of this status competition comes through housing. […] This places a lot of pressure on Chinese families with sons to demonstrate their value through homeownership.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
We found that home prices are higher and home sizes are bigger in cities with more skewed sex ratios. Strikingly, the sex ratio imbalance explained between half and one-third of the increase in housing prices in 25 major cities between 2003 and 2009.

        <h3 id="getting-food">Getting food</h3>
<h4 id="foraging">Foraging</h4>
<p>Anatomically modern humans showed up to the party rather late—perhaps as late as only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/26/science/when-humans-became-human.html">130,000 years ago</a>. This was right also right around the time <i>Homo sapiens</i> become <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-the-use-of-ochre-tells-us-about-the-capabilities-of-our-african-ancestry-47081">cognitively modern and capable of symbolic thought</a>. But looking good and thinking symbolically do not a good party make. Everyone would have been leaning against the wall and stealing furtive glances at each other for many millennia until they worked up the courage to finally invent language and talk to each other around 50,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So, regardless of what you use as your benchmark for modernity—anatomic, cognitive, or linguistic, the advent of food production in around 8,000 B.C.E. is relatively recent. That means, for most of human history, we’ve been foragers. “Foragers” are often called “hunter-gatherers” but this name is somewhat misleading. Hunting and gathering each typically contribute about 25-35% of caloric intake while fishing constituted the remaining 30-50%.</p>
<p>There is ongoing debate about just how sweet the pre-historic foraging life was. On one hand, per capita GDP between $90 and $200 for essentially forever doesn’t sound so hot <span class="citation" data-cites="delong1998estimating">(DeLong <a href="#ref-delong1998estimating">1998</a>)</span> from the perspective of modernity. On the other hand, as we mentioned in <a href="./posts/anthropological-clickbait/">a previous post</a>, even modern foragers (who are typically thought to live in more marginal territory than early foragers) work fairly little. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people">!Kung</a> spend only about 42 hours on foraging, housework and tool-making all together. On the third hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zerzan">John <span class="noted">“You’ve to break a few billion eggs to make an omelet”</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Zerzan</a> is on the primitivist side so no thank you.</p>
<h4 id="food-production">Food production</h4>
<p>Like we said, the earliest food production arose in around 8,000 B.C.E. in the Near East.</p>
<p>Food production perhaps arose because it was the only way to support increased population. At some point, new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society">bands</a> of humans simply ran out of unoccupied territory to move into. Thereafter, population density would have increased beyond what foraging could support and horticulture, more productive per unit area than foraging, would have been the only option. This commonsensical theory of the rise of food production is called the Binford-Flannery model.</p>
<p>An alternative theory is that climate change reduced the availability of wild food supplies.</p>
<p>Regardless of the origin story, there are three major categories of food production:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Horticulture</dt>
<dd>“Plant cultivation carried out with relatively simple tools and methods”. Probably the earliest form of food production. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_cultivation">Shifting cultivation</a>, in which land is worked temporarily and then abandoned while soil nutrients naturally replenish, is a common form. 60 of 186 <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> cultures are horticultural (variable 246) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Intensive agriculture</dt>
<dd>“Food production characterized by the permanent cultivation of fields and made possible by the use of the plow, draft animals or machines, fertilizers, irrigation, water-storage techniques, and other complex agricultural techniques.” 57 of 186 <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> cultures are intensively agricultural (variable 246) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Pastoralism</dt>
<dd>“A form of subsistence technology in which food-getting is based directly or indirectly on the maintenance of domesticated animals.” 16 of 186 cultures <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> are pastoral (variable 246) <span class="citation" data-cites="murdock1969standard">(Murdock and White <a href="#ref-murdock1969standard">1969</a>)</span>.

        <p>We’ve already established that I’m a fan of <a href="./posts/why-opposition-pigovian-taxes/">Pigouvian taxes</a> and correcting externalities. The harms I visit on my neighbor should be the result of malice aforethought; we should have to look each other in the eye rather than shrug in world-weary acknowledgment of systemic perversities. Because of that interest, I wanted a sense of the total magnitude of Pigouvian taxation possible. Are American GDP numbers the result of accounting fraud that would put <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron">Enron</a> to shame? How much would American production numbers decrease if we accounted for externalities? If the federal government shared my zeal for technocratic delights, how much of the federal budget could be funded by Pigouvian taxes? How much would an individual’s annual expenses increase if they’d internalized all their externalities and been absolved of their sins?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, I reviewed the academic literature and found every proposed Pigouvian tax I could. I did not include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>General sin taxes</dt>
<dd>Public health practitioners and others sometimes talk about taxing certain goods on the grounds that they correct for irrationality. <del>Plebes</del> People don’t know about the long-term harmful effects of sugary drinks or lack self-control, for example. Or cigarette taxes should be increased to stop people from <del>enjoying themselves</del> killing themselves prematurely. While there are reasonable arguments (despite the snark above) in support of such taxes, these aren’t the same as Pigouvian taxes. Pigouvian taxes correct for externalities and arise even with rAtIoNaL actors due to inherent failures of markets; these other taxes try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)">nudge</a> toward actions that don’t create externalities and wouldn’t occur with rAtIoNaL actors.
</dd>
<dt>Uncalibrated taxes</dt>
<dd>There are many jurisdictions that have taxes on externality-producing consumption—think cigarette taxes or alcohol taxes. However, these are just as likely to be the result of smoky backroom deals as of analysis grounded in an estimation of the externalities imposed by consumption. Thus, I excluded them and only looked for taxes (real or proposed) where numbers were intended to precisely ‘internalize’ externalities.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The results of this review are presented in the table below. The externalities associated with emitting carbon and driving are the largest by far. If we sum up all the known externalities listed in the table, we find that they come to $679 billion per year in the US. This is around 3.5% of US GDP and around 15% of <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-spending-3305763">US federal spending</a>. The per capita cost of these externalities is around over $2150 per year. (The sum of externalities is described on annual basis and so excludes quantities which are stocks rather than annual flows. In particular, obesity and <abbr title="Small and medium enterprises">SME</abbr> debt are current totals rather than annual changes.)</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>It’s pretty easy to find instances of people claiming to support some goal but opposing Pigouvian taxes that work toward that goal. Economists love Pigouvian taxes. Why don’t the laity? Some objections seems to be based on a misunderstanding—the distributional impact of a well-designed gas tax, for example—while others—the preference for allowing harm over doing harm—seem to be more dearly held.</p></div>
       

        <p>Paris and other French cities have recently been the site of large and heated (there were fires) protests. The most prominent symbol of the protests is the high-visibility <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement"><abbr title="yellow vests"><i>gilets jaunes</i></abbr></a> which all French motorists are required to own. This symbol is fitting for a series of protests that coalesced in opposition to an increase in the gas tax. While this protest (and any other protest) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/world/europe/france-fuel-carbon-tax.html">isn’t about a single grievance</a>, it certainly seems to signify something about the popular opinion of gas taxes.</p>
<p>These protests pair <span class="noted">somewhat uncomfortably</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with the popular <a href="https://www.independent.ie/world-news/thousands-march-in-paris-against-climate-change-37296183.html">march against climate change in Paris</a> just three months ago.</p>
<p>This pattern seems common: Acknowledgment that global warming and excessive fossil fuel use are problems which must be addressed followed by reluctance or opposition to concrete responses <span class="citation" data-cites="leiserowitz2006climate">(Leiserowitz <a href="#ref-leiserowitz2006climate">2006</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>(Carbon taxes aren’t always doomed to failure. British Columbia has had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_carbon_tax">a carbon tax of $35 per tonne</a> in place since 2008. Sweden has the world’s highest <a href="https://www.government.se/government-policy/taxes-and-tariffs/swedens-carbon-tax/">carbon tax at about $138 per tonne</a>. California recently voted down <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_6,_Voter_Approval_for_Future_Gas_and_Vehicle_Taxes_and_2017_Tax_Repeal_Initiative_(2018)">a repeal of recent gas tax increases</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="pigouvian-taxes">Pigouvian taxes</h3>
<h4 id="what-are-pigouvian-taxes">What are Pigouvian taxes?</h4>
<p>So gas and carbon taxes are controversial with the public. Not so for economists and technocrats. They are both examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigouvian_tax">Pigouvian taxes</a>. In brief, Pigouvian taxes seek to correct market failures arising from negative externalities. A negative externality is any cost generated by a market activity that is not priced into the market exchange.</p>
<p>For example, local air pollution caused by combustion of gasoline harms other nearby people—think especially of those who don’t even own a car—who receive nothing in exchange for bearing this harm. Because these costs aren’t included in the price of gasoline, gas is cheaper than it ought to be, all things considered. This leads to overconsumption of gasoline.</p>
<p>A Pigouvian tax tries to remedy this market failure by making the ‘invisible’ costs of externalities manifest via a tax. If the total external costs of driving—due to externalities like greenhouse warming, congestion and local pollution—amount to $1.76 per gallon (an estimate from <span class="citation" data-cites="parry2007">(Parry, Walls, and Harrington <a href="#ref-parry2007">2007</a>)</span>), a tax of $1.76 on each gallon forces the gasoline purchaser to ‘internalize’ those costs—account for the social harm they are creating with their actions.</p>
<h4 id="a-tax-only-an-economist-could-love">A tax only an economist could love</h4>
<p>“Economists are in almost universal agreement that, in concept, pollution taxes are the most cost-effective means of reducing pollution” <span class="citation" data-cites="hsu2009psychological">(Hsu <a href="#ref-hsu2009psychological">2009</a>)</span>. In a direct survey, 65% of economists attested that there should be an overall increase in energy taxes <span class="citation" data-cites="whaples2006economists">(Whaples <a href="#ref-whaples2006economists">2006</a>)</span>. Gregory Mankiw keeps a partial list of prominent economists that support Pigouvian taxes in the form of the <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/09/rogoff-joins-pigou-club.html">membership rolls of the Pigou Club</a>.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, only 5% of the general public supported a tax on driving in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118304470725951593">a 2007 survey</a>.</p>
<p>For a (very accessible) fuller discussion in support of Pigouvian taxes from an economist, see <span class="citation" data-cites="mankiw2009">(Mankiw <a href="#ref-mankiw2009">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-oppose">Reasons to oppose</h3>
<p>I’ll confess myself to be on the side of economists when it comes to Pigouvian taxes. I’m then left with the question, why are they so unpopular with the general public? There are many possible reasons which we’ll now rehearse (Though we will stick to arguments where there’s something interesting to say about Pigouvian taxes specifically; we won’t rehash arguments about whether the government should ever intervene in the market, can be trusted, &amp;c.) . Since the case for Pigouvian taxes rests on both positive (these are the effects of Pigouvian taxes) and normative (these effects are good) premises, <span class="noted">we’ll categorize</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the objections as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Misapprehensions of the positive</li>
<li>Disagreements with the positive</li>
<li>Misapprehensions of the normative</li>
<li>Disagreements with the normative</li>

<blockquote>
In Japan, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_spoken_Japanese">males and females use entirely different words</a> for numerous concepts (e.g., the male word for water is mizu; the female version is ohiya)

Some linguists believe that the approximate location of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-language">protolanguage</a> is suggested by the words for plants and animals in the derived languages. More specifically, among these different languages, the words that are cognates—that is, words that are similar in sound and meaning—presumably refer to plants and animals that were present in the original homeland. So, if we know where those animals and plants were located 5,000 years to 6,000 years ago, we can guess where <abbr title="Proto-Indo-European"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language">PIE</a></abbr> people lived.

<blockquote>
[Bickerton] says that the “errors” children make in speaking are consistent with the grammar of creoles. For example, English-speaking children 3 to 4 years old tend to ask questions by intonation alone, and they tend to use double negatives, such as “I don’t see no dog,” even though the adults around them do not speak that way
