         <div class="abstract"><p>An immortal dictator would have more incentive for increasing long run growth and could thus be more economically liberal.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="life-extension-in-autocrats">Life extension in autocrats</h3>
<p>In a <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bryan-caplan-case-for-and-against-education/">recent episode of the 80,000 hours podcast</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html">Bryan Caplan</a> briefly talked about totalitarianism. During that section of the conversation, he dropped this tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
[F]un fact is Stalin actually had a life-extension program dedicated to try to make himself immortal. It didn’t work, but my view that is if it worked, than I think the Soviet Union would still be ruled by Joseph Stalin.
</blockquote>
<h3 id="incentive-alignment">Incentive alignment</h3>
<p>Infinite tyrants sound worse than finite tyrants. But there’s a silver lining: Long tenure in autocrats discourages rapacity.</p>
<h4 id="theory">Theory</h4>
<p>For the theoretical argument, we turn to <span class="citation" data-cites="olson1993">(Olson <a href="#ref-olson1993">1993</a>)</span>. First, we suppose an autocrat is a rational, economically informed actor trying to maximize their total consumption over their lifetime. Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that an economy will generate its maximum income only if there is a high rate of investment and that much of the return on long-term investments is received long after the investment is made. This means that an autocrat who is taking a long view will try to convince his subjects that their assets will be permanently protected not only from theft by others but also from expropriation by the autocrat himself. If his subjects fear expropriation, they will invest less, and in the long run his tax collections will be reduced.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
Now suppose that an autocrat is only concerned about getting through the next year. He will then gain by expropriating any convenient capital asset whose tax yield over the year is less than its total value.
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond limiting expropriation, an immortal autocrat would want to support other economic freedoms that increase long-run growth—as long as they encourage growth more than they imperil the autocrat. Other things in this category might include: the impartial enforcement of contracts and a stable currency.</p>
<p>Recapitulating, an autocrat that orients toward the long run gets to consume more in the long run—as long as they stay in power. All else equal, an immortal autocrat will stay in power longer than a merely mortal autocrat and thus has more incentive to focus on the long run. The good news is that everyone else also gets to consume more and enjoy more economic freedoms along the way.</p>

       </div>

       

        <p><a href="./posts/moral-limits-markets-summary/">Last time</a>, I summarized Michael Sandel’s <i>What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets</i> <span class="citation" data-cites="sandel2012">(Sandel <a href="#ref-sandel2012">2012</a>)</span>. Now, I’ll say my own things instead of regurgitating Sandel (as delicious as premasticated Sandel may be).</p>
<p>Throughout, I’ll try to resist temptation and keep the discussion to the <em>moral</em> failings of markets. There’s a whole vast literature on how and when markets fail on their own terms (i.e. don’t achieve social efficiency) that I’d like to avoid.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve tried to order things for comprehensibility, but there isn’t a single, coherent thesis here. Most of the sections are standalone.</p>
<h3 id="markets-defined">Markets defined</h3>
<p>I think it behooves us to start with a discussion of precisely what markets are. This should clarify and it should help us understand which features of markets are necessary and which contingent.</p>
<p>Without thinking <em>too</em> deeply about it, I’ll say a market is a legal and sociocultural system via which unaffiliated parties may exchange rights—paradigmatically, one party gives up the rights for exclusive use (viz., property rights) of some tangible good and receives in exchange the rights for exclusive use of some quantity of money. I choose this annoyingly abstract definition to highlight the flexibility and generality of markets which is important when talking about atypical markets.</p>
<h3 id="markets-vs.property">Markets vs. property</h3>
<p>This definition quickly suggests the importance of distinguishing between markets (the mechanism of exchange) and property (what’s exchanged on the market). Property (or some other bundle of rights) is a precondition to markets. Unfortunately, I think the book rather wholly <span class="noted">elides this distinction</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Many of the ills attributed to atypical markets are more accurately pinned on property. In fact, I can’t think of any examples where ‘propertizing’ (i.e. formalizing and legislating the rights to some formerly fuzzy thing) is okay and market exchange is <span class="noted">squicky</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. If the market in slaves had been abolished and ownership of slaves could be transferred only by inheritance, chattel slavery would have been no less appalling.</p>
<p>This isn’t pure, idle pedantry. By omitting markets from the story, we highlight that core to the corruption concern is people relinquishing capacities we’d rather they keep. From this perspective, the problem with women agreeing to be sterilized for cash is that they’re relinquishing their reproductive rights while we think they ought to be inalienable; it invites outsiders in to our bodies. “Bank One blast” rankles because our choice of words ought to be our own; to do otherwise is to invite outsiders in to our minds.</p>
<p>We’re then left with the question: Is it best to deny people the capacity to relinquish certain capacities? Morally? Politically?</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>Markets continue to expand into areas that were once governed by other mechanisms. But markets can be unfair and they can corrupt the goods allocated by them. Because markets have a moral dimension, their continued expansion means that economic reasoning must explicitly embrace moral reasoning.</p></div>
       

        <p>I recently read Michael Sandel’s <i>What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets</i> <span class="citation" data-cites="sandel2012">(Sandel <a href="#ref-sandel2012">2012</a>)</span>.

<h3 id="scope-of-markets">Scope of markets</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative">There is no alternative</a>. Markets are inescapable. But markets now extend beyond the mere exchange of commercial products into “spheres of life once governed by nonmarket norms”.</p>
<p>The book offers many, many (many) examples of this including:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
[I]n 2001, [a] British novelist […] wrote a book commissioned by Bulgari […]. [The author] agreed to mention Bulgari jewelry in the novel at least a dozen times. The book, aptly titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulgari_Connection">The Bulgari Connection</a> […] more than exceeded the required number of product references, mentioning Bulgari thirty-four times. [One critic] pointed to the clunkiness of the product-laden prose as in sentences such as this: “‘A Bulgari necklace in the hand is worth two in the bush,’ said Doris.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[T]he Campbell Soup Company sent out a free science kit that purported to teach the scientific method. With the use of a slotted spoon (included in the kit), students were shown how to prove that Campbell’s Prego spaghetti sauce was thicker than Ragú, the rival brand. General Mills sent teachers a science curriculum on volcanoes called “Gushers: Wonders of the Earth.” The kit included free samples of its Fruit Gushers candy, with soft centers that “gushed” when bitten. The teacher’s guide suggested that students bite into the Gushers and compare the effect to a geothermal eruption.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
When a bank bought the right to name the Arizona Diamondbacks’ stadium Bank One Ballpark, the deal also required that the team’s broadcasters call each Arizona home run a “Bank One blast.” […] Even sliding into home is now a corporate-sponsored event. [… F]or example, when the umpire calls a runner safe at home plate, a corporate logo appears on the television screen, and the play-by-play announcer must say, “Safe at home. Safe and secure. New York Life.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[The] North Carolina-based charity called Project Prevention, has a market-based solution: offer drug-addicted women $300 cash if they will undergo sterilization or long-term birth control. More than three thousand women have taken [up] the offer since […] 1997.
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
Becker even proposed charging admission to refugees fleeing persecution. The free market, he claimed, would make it easy to decide which refugees to accept—those sufficiently motivated to pay the price: “For obvious reasons, political refugees and those persecuted in their own countries would be willing to pay a sizeable fee to gain admission to a free nation. So a fee system would automatically avoid time-consuming hearings about whether they are really in physical danger if they were forced to return home.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
[There was another] use of life insurance that arose in the 1980s and 1990s, prompted by the AIDS epidemic. It was called the viatical industry. It consisted of a market in the life insurance policies of people with AIDS and others who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. Here is how it worked: Suppose someone with a $100,000 life insurance policy is told by his doctor that he has only a year to live. And suppose he needs money now for medical care, or perhaps simply to live well in the short time he has remaining. An investor offers to buy the policy from the ailing person at a discount, say, $50,000, and takes over payment of the annual premiums. When the original policyholder dies, the investor collects the $100,000.

         <div class="abstract"><p>Donor lotteries are a way for small donors to pool their funds in the hopes that economies of scale will make them more effective. Some people worry about whether others in the lottery are aligned. A parable about a donor lottery with devil illustrates that we should be willing to enter donor lotteries with those opposed to us as long as they have smaller economies of scale.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="donor-lotteries">Donor lotteries</h3>
<p>Effective altruists have proposed and promoted <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14d/donor_lotteries_demonstration_and_faq/">donor lotteries</a>. Briefly, in a donor lottery, donors pool money for charitable contribution. They’re given lottery tickets in proportion to their contributions. The winner of the lottery gets to decide where the pool of charitable funds should be donated. For example, two people each set aside $1,000 for charitable contribution. They then make an agreement and the winner of the coin flip gets to donate the whole $2,000 to the charity of their choosing.</p>
<p>The primary claimed advantage to these lotteries is economies of scale. It probably doesn’t make sense to spend 100 hours picking the absolutely perfect charity when you’re only disbursing $1000 as a solo donor. It probably does make sense to spend the time to make the decision carefully when disbursing $100,000 as the winner of a donor lottery. Other economies of scale include things like: improved chance of response when asking charities for more information, can fund projects with threshold cost (i.e. we can’t even start the project unless we receive at least $XX,000 dollars).</p>
<h3 id="a-common-concern">A common concern</h3>
<p>Though the original proposals all highlight that the primary benefit of donor lotteries is economies of scale, I’ve heard many in the EA community concerned about alignment of other donors: “What if I don’t trust others in the lottery to do thorough research?” “What if others in the lottery prioritize different cause areas?”</p>
<p>Though early advocates address these concerns briefly, subsequent discussions suggests it might be useful to address these concerns more vividly.</p>
<h3 id="donor-lottery-with-the-devil">Donor lottery with the devil</h3>
<p>I contend you should be willing to enter a donor lottery with the devil (this is the weirdly honorable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil">Faustian</a> devil that respects all his compacts). To see this, we just proceed systematically.</p>
<p>Suppose you and the devil each contribute $10,000 dollars. This is your life savings while the devil merely tosses in a carbuncular carbuncle from his pit of gems and anguish. You flip a fair coin.</p>

A few weeks ago, I had an unusual — and challenging — assignment: providing a one-hour “tutorial” on the basic science of human-induced climate change to a Federal District Court in San Francisco. Judge William Alsup had requested this tutorial to bring him up to speed on the fundamental science before proceedings begin in earnest in a case brought by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, on behalf of the people of California, against a group of major fossil fuel companies, addressing the costs of climate change caused, they argue, by products those companies have sold.

<p>The paper’s a bit meandering, but I think the core idea—that a universal basic income and a job guarantee aren’t mutually exclusive or even particularly competitive—is valuable and true. The most import sources of conflict are probably finite supplies of political capital and the enormous complexity of implementing one of these policies, yet alone two.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Under simple majority rule, a largely indifferent majority can approve a result that is intensely opposed by everyone in the minority. If out-and-out bribery were permitted, it would be relatively easy for the minority to bribe the majority faction to defeat the hated policy, and, since the minority does really hate the original proposal, both they and the majority would be, on balance, better off in the post-bribe situation. The original result of majority rule was not Pareto optimal. It was economically inefficient.</p>
In the real world, it is not necessary to buy votes, either of individual voters or their representatives. What we actually see as a part of normal democratic practice is a process of vote trading, sometimes called “logrolling.” Voter 1 cares deeply about issue A but not about issue B. It is then rational for voter 1 to trade his vote on B for voter 2’s vote on A. As a result, everyone is better off. Dennis Mueller, Geoffrey Philpotts, and Jaroslav Vanek demonstrated in a 1972 paper in Public Choice that the analogy between the efficiency of ordinary markets and the efficiency of vote trading in the political sphere is almost perfect.1 In nearly all cases, a system of logrolling will take a society to a state very close to Pareto optimality.Earmarks are merely a special case of logrolling. They enable political minorities (even a minority of one) to have an impact on policy, despite an apathetic or even hostile majority.

<p>Interestingly, most of the reasons advanced here aren’t about social psychology being ‘worse’ than other fields (e.g. more corrupt, less competent) but ‘better’ (e.g. more open with data, replications are easier). The one explanation offered contrary to that pattern is “psychology studies often (not always, but often) feature weak theory + weak measurement”.</p></li>

         <div class="abstract"><p>There’s not a lot of high quality evidence, but it seems plausible to the author that the putting-out system was better for workers than the factory system and that most gig workers would prefer more standard employment.</p></div>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p><a href="./posts/putting-out-gig-economy-i/">Last time</a> we reviewed the putting out system—a pre-industrial system of manufacture used in England where workers would take intermediate products home, refine them in some way, and return them to a merchant so that some other worker could perform the next step in the production process. Then, I suggested that this system sounds a lot like the modern gig economy.</p>
<p>Which left us with the question: Why is the gig economy worse than regular, full-time employment (for workers), but putting-out was better than factories (for workers)? We can resolve this tension by either finding that contemporary praise of the putting out system is wrong, finding that criticism of the gig economy is wrong, or (hint, hint) highlighting the disanalogies between the systems.</p>
<h3 id="was-putting-out-actually-preferred-to-factories">Was putting-out actually preferred to factories?</h3>
<h4 id="direct-evidence">Direct evidence</h4>
<p>Obviously, we can’t answer this question definitively and our <span class="noted">direct evidence</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is weak. One piece of direct evidence we do have is contemporary complaints about the factory system like that in the epigraph. Of course, these are only anecdotes and it’s hard to generalize or be sure they’re representative, but, try as I might, I couldn’t find any anecdotes on the other side of the issue—there were no early factory workers singing praises of child labor and 14 hour days.</p>
<p>Another piece of information which tends to reveal preferences is: “[W]here alternatives to factory employment were available, there is evidence that workers flocked to them. […] [D]espite the abysmally low level to which wages fell [in the non-factory cotton weaving industry], a force of domestic cotton weavers numbering some 250,000 survived well into the nineteenth century.” <span class="citation" data-cites="marglin1974">(Marglin <a href="#ref-marglin1974">1974</a>)</span> It is, of course, impossible to be certain that worker aversion to factories is what drove this behavior.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>There is an analogy to be found between choice functions and ethical theories. Both select a distinguished element/action from a collection of sets/actions.

        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Ethics is fundamentally about ‘ought’. What ought we to do? Which actions are proscribed and which prescribed? Among all available actions, which should we actually pursue? I think we can formalize this basic understanding and draw some interesting conclusions.</p>
<p>For any given ethical decision, we have some nonempty set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> (depending on how we individuate, possibly infinite) of possible actions. But, alas, we cannot perform all these actions; only one. So an ethical theory is something that for every possible <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> selects a distinguished element <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>. That is, an ethical theory is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function">choice function</a> over nonempty sets of actions.</p>
<p>In the rest of the post, we’ll discuss what properties such an ethical choice function might have and build up an understanding of how the tools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order theory</a> might be applied to metaethical reasoning.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>The von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem lets us turn an ordinal utility function into a cardinal utility function. Here, we have an interactive widget that actually constructs a utility function from a series of questions using the theorem.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="von-neumannmorgenstern-utility-theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</a> says that, “under certain axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he or she is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future”. But the somewhat sloppy way I like to think of it is this: If a person has merely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility">ordinal preferences</a> (e.g. I prefer an apple to a banana but can’t or won’t quantify the magnitude of that preference. The preceding information alone isn’t enough to conclude how I’d feel about one apple vs. two bananas.) and reasons well under uncertainty, we can transform those ordinal preferences into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility">cardinal utility function</a> (e.g. I like apples exactly twice as much as bananas and would be indifferent between an apple and two bananas (ignoring diminishing marginal utility for the same of exposition).).</p>
<p>This transformation is often useful because a cardinal utility function is much richer and more informative than an ordinal utility function. The extra information is useful, for example, in sidestepping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s impossibility theorem</a> (which says that it’s impossible to have a good voting system if you only ask people for their ordering of candidates).</p>
<h3 id="interactive-vnm">Interactive VNM</h3>
<p>The standard descriptions of the mechanism of the VNM utility theorem may be a little opaque. But because the theorem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof">constructive</a>, we can actually give people a feel for it by putting them ‘inside’ the mechanism and showing them the result. That’s what we attempt here.</p>
<p>In the first text area, enter a list of goods (each on a separate line) for which you’d like to generate a utility function. It starts with a few sample goods, but you’re free to add, remove or otherwise alter these.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided upon the goods you’re interested in, you can proceed to the next step. Here, you’ll be presented with a series of lotteries. In each lottery, you have to decide whether you prefer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> lottery tickets for one good over <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> lottery tickets for the other good, or if you’re indifferent. If your lottery ticket is drawn, you win whatever good is on the ticket. You can register your answer as to which set of tickets you prefer by clicking on one of the three blue boxes.</p>
<p>For example, if you mildly prefer bananas to carrots, you’d click on the banana box when presented with one lottery ticket for each. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot, by your lights (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>). On the other hand (because your preference was only mild), you’d click on the carrot box if offered 100 carrot tickets vs. 1 banana ticket. A <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{n}\)</span> chance of a carrot is better than a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> chance of a banana (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 101\)</span>).</p>
<p>After you’ve repeated this process enough, we can deduce what your favorite good of all the listed goods is. With this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire">numéraire</a>, we can start to visualize your utility function and do so with a chart that appears at the bottom. But, of course, we still have uncertainty about the relative value of these goods. Based on the questions you answer, we know upper and lower bounds for your value (a carrot is better than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100}\)</span> banana but worse than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1}\)</span> banana). Over time, by answering more questions, we can refine these intervals until they’re arbitrarily small.</p>
