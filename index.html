This post tries to give an overview of the field highlighting key terminology, open problems, and categories of responses to those problems.</p></div>

<p>Epistemology is the study of <a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="knowledge" class="arg-map">knowledge</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-knowledge"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="what" class="arg-map">What is knowledge?</a></h3>
<p>For literally millenia, people were content to think of knowledge as justified true belief <span class="citation" data-cites="plato360">(Plato <a href="#ref-plato360">360BC</a>)</span>. Let’s break that down briefly:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Belief</dt>
<dd>A belief is mental content held as true. Thinking to myself, with conviction, “I am a human.” and “I am a dragon.” are each equally examples of beliefs.
</dd>
<dt>True</dt>
<dd>Alas, only one of the above claims is true. Even if I have very convincing hallucinations of breathing fire and flying, “I am a dragon” is merely justified belief. It’s not true and so not knowledge.
</dd>
<dt>Justified</dt>
<dd>On the other hand, if I stumble onto true belief, it still doesn’t count as knowledge. If you roll a 100-sided die and hide the result under a cup, I don’t <em>know</em> that the result is 64 even if I believe it and it turns out to be true—I have no justification for the belief.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It’s only when beliefs are both true <em>and</em> justified that they count as knowledge. Sounds reasonable, right?</p>
<h4 id="gettier-problem"><a href="#yaas-epistemology-map" id="gettier" class="arg-map">Gettier problem</a></h4>
<p>Not to Edmund Gettier. In a three page paper <span class="citation" data-cites="gettier1963">(Gettier <a href="#ref-gettier1963">1963</a>)</span>, he presented two compelling counterexamples to this analysis. An example of this vein of anecdote is:</p>
<p>Whetu is driving home from work one day and happens to see her coworker Sigrún in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2_(T3)">Vanagon</a>. She thinks to herself, “Ah, one of my coworkers owns a Vanagon.” However, unbeknownst to Whetu, Sigrún does not actually own the Vanagon she was driving—she was in the midst of stealing it. But, coincidentally, one of Whetu’s other coworkers <em>does</em> own a Vanagon.</p>
<p>So Whetu’s initial belief—“One of my coworkers owns a Vanagon”—turns out to be true and justified (we’ll count seeing someone driving a car as convincing justification for believing that they own it). But intuitively, we’re reluctant to accept that Whetu knows that one of her coworkers owns a Vanagon. It seems like she just got lucky—her mistaken justification was rescued by a fact that she would be surprised to learn.</p>

        <h3 id="the-decline-and-rise-of-long-term-memory">The decline and rise of long-term memory</h3>
<p>I used to scorn long-term memory. My brain is an exquisite organ for vanquishing conundra, thank you very much, not some library card catalog. I assume I assimilated this attitude from <span class="noted">discussion like</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>But, after reading up on pedagogy in articles like <a href="./posts/human-cognitive-architecture-learning">the one we discussed earlier</a>, “[I] no longer see longterm memory as a repository of isolated, unrelated facts that are occasionally stored and retrieved; instead, it is the central structure of human cognitive architecture.” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span></p>
<h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h3>
<p>Thus, I present my own entry in the burgeoning <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">subgenre</a> of <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition software</a> <a href="http://devonzuegel.com/post/thoughts-on-spaced-repetition">encomia</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> software optimally schedules flashcard review to radically boost retention of information in long-term memory. Anki is one such program. I’d heard of Anki in the past but only managed to acquire the habit of regular review more recently. I’ve performed a total of 4803 reviews of 1518 cards during review sessions covering 40 of the last 42 days (Let it never be said that I do things in half measures.). This is probably too intense and more than I’d recommend for most people. But that information should serve to calibrate you as to how much experience I have with Anki.</p>
<h4 id="the-feel-of-a-thing">The feel of a thing</h4>
<p>The dominant feeling I now have is a mild frustration at the betrayal of present me by past me—so much of my prior reading and general intellectual development was wasted effort. If we each had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a> and forgot 100% of what we’d read or otherwise experienced, we’d surely take a different approach to life. We wouldn’t just wander along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)">learning and forgetting in an endless cycle</a>. But the truth of our memories is not so far off!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The meteorite itself was so massive that it didn’t notice any atmosphere whatsoever,” said Rebolledo. “It was traveling 20 to 40 kilometers per second, 10 kilometers — probably 14 kilometers — wide, pushing the atmosphere and building such incredible pressure that the ocean in front of it just went away.”</p>
<p>These numbers are precise without usefully conveying the scale of the calamity. What they mean is that a rock larger than Mount Everest hit planet Earth traveling twenty times faster than a bullet. This is so fast that it would have traversed the distance from the cruising altitude of a 747 to the ground in 0.3 seconds. The asteroid itself was so large that, even at the moment of impact, the top of it might have still towered more than a mile above the cruising altitude of a 747. In its nearly instantaneous descent, it compressed the air below it so violently that it briefly became several times hotter than the surface of the sun.</p>
<p>“The pressure of the atmosphere in front of the asteroid started excavating the crater before it even got there,” Rebolledo said. “Them when the meteorite touched ground zero, it was totally intact. It was so massive that the atmosphere didn’t even make a scratch on it.”</p>
<p>Unlike the typical Hollywood CGI depictions of asteroid impacts, where an extraterrestrial charcoal briquette gently smolders across the sky, in the Yucatan it would have been a pleasant day one second and the world was already over by the next. As the asteroid collided with the earth, in the sky above it where there should have been air, the rock had punched a hole of outer space vacuum in the atmosphere. As the heavens rushed in to close this hole, enormous volumes of earth were expelled into orbit and beyond — all within a second or two of impact.</p>
<p>“So there’s probably little bits of dinosaur bone up on the moon,” I asked.</p>
“Yeah, probably.”

The shortest-lived child of Prohibition actually survived to adulthood. This was the change in drinking patterns that depressed the level of consumption compared with the pre-Prohibition years. Straitened family finances during the Depression of course kept the annual per capita consumption rate low, hovering around 1.5 US gallons. The true results of Prohibition’s success in socializing Americans in temperate habits became apparent during World War II, when the federal government turned a more cordial face toward the liquor industry than it had during World War I, and they became even more evident during the prosperous years that followed.50 Although annual consumption rose, to about 2 gallons per capita in the 1950s and 2.4 gallons in the 1960s, it did not surpass the pre-Prohibition peak until the early 1970s.

        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference">principle of indifference</a> (a.k.a. the principle of insufficient reason) suggests that when considering a set of possibilities and there’s no known reason for granting special credence to one possibility, we ought to assign all possibilities the same credence (which, on the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/">Bayesian</a> point of view, is also a probability). For example, when someone asks what the result of a 6-sided die roll is, the principle of indifference recommends we assign a probability of 1/6 to each outcome. Slightly more interesting is that it /also/ recommends assigning a probability of 1/6 to each outcome even when we’re told the die is weighted as long as we’re not told how it’s weighted.</p>
<p>There’s a definite intuitive plausibility and appeal to this rule. But it turns out there are a lot of difficulties when it comes to actually operationalizing it. Below, I list some of the problems that have been raised over the years. Some of these problems seem silly to me and will doubtless seem silly to you. Others strike me as important. I list them all here regardless and ignore any claimed solutions for the moment.</p>
<h3 id="coarsening">Coarsening</h3>
<p>“What is the origin country of this unknown traveler? France, Ireland or Great Britain?”</p>
<p>Naive application of the principle of indifference (NAPI) suggests we assign probability 1/3 to each possibility.</p>
<p>The question can be rephrased: “What is the origin country of this unknown traveler? France, or the British Isles?”.</p>
<p>In this case, NAPI suggests we ought to assign a probability 1/2 to each possibility.</p>
<p>So, depending on the framing, we assign probability 1/2 or 1/3 to the same outcome—the traveler is from France.</p>
<h3 id="negation">Negation</h3>
<p>“I’ve just pulled a colored ball from an urn containing an equal number of red, black and yellow balls. Which color is the ball? Red, black, or yellow?”</p>
<p>NAPI suggests we assign probability 1/3 to each possibility.</p>
<p>The question can be rephrased: “Which color is the ball? Red or not red?”.</p>
<p>In this case, NAPI suggests we ought to assign a probability 1/2 to each possibility.</p>
<p>So, depending on the framing, we assign probability 1/2 or 1/3 to the same outcome—the ball is red.</p>
<h3 id="bertrand-paradox"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_paradox_(probability)">Bertrand paradox</a></h3>
<p>“I have an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. I’ve also chosen a chord in the circle randomly. What is the probability that the chord is longer than a side of the triangle?”</p>
<p>If we construct our random chords by choosing two random points on the circumference of the circle and construct a chord between them, we find that the probability of a long chord is 1/3.</p>
<p>If we construct our random chords by choosing a random radius and then constructing a chord perpendicular to a random point on that radius, we find that the probability of a long chord is 1/2.</p>
<p>If we construct our random chords by choosing a random point inside the circle and constructing a chord with that point as its midpoint, we find that the probability of a long chord is 1/4.</p>
<p>So depending on our framing, we assign probability of 1/4, 1/3 or 1/2 to the same proposition.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>The ideal theory debate is actually applied decision theory. The tools and vocabulary of decision theory—at a minimum, the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem, the concept of epistemic risk aversion, and the area of sequential decision theory—are useful in this new domain.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="ideal-theory">Ideal theory</h3>
<p>If I may editorialize, the ideal theory debate is essentially about how to translate our understanding of justice into actions in the present. Reductively, one side (the idealists) advocates for always moving the world we inhabit closer to the ideally just world while the other side (the non-idealists) advocates for always moving the world we inhabit toward the best adjacent world.</p>
<p>What’s not usually at issue in the ideal theory debate is: our understanding of the status quo, our predictive models of the future, or our notion of justice. That’s not to say that there’s consensus on these issues—far from it. It’s just that discussion of these issues doesn’t fall under the heading of ‘ideal theory’. No one considers themselves to be waging that debate when they talk about currently existing inequality in Germany or what justice recommends with regard to positive and negative rights. By all this I merely mean to emphasize that the scope of the ideal theory debate is rather small—given all the presuppositions above, what algorithm do we employ to choose the next possible world we’ll inhabit?</p>
<p>Hopefully, by framing the ideal theory debate in the foregoing terms, I’ve predisposed you to my point of view: The subject matter of the ideal theory debate is also the subject matter of decision theory. That is, the ideal theory debate is really a debate about applied decision theory.</p>
<h3 id="normative-decision-theory">Normative decision theory</h3>
<p><del><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/religionprof/2016/12/websters-dictionary-defines.html">Webster’s dictionary defines</a></del>—*cough*—<span class="citation" data-cites="hansson1994">(Hansson <a href="#ref-hansson1994">1994</a>)</span> says “decision theory is concerned with goal-directed behaviour in the presence of options”. We’ll try to make this description more comprehensive by appealing to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory/#SavThe">Leonard Savage’s formalization</a>. The hope is that by describing decision theory fully, we can see how the boundaries of the ideal theory debate line up with the boundaries of decision theory.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>Problem-solving relies on working memory. Working memory is very limited except when it comes to information that’s also in long-term memory. Long-term memory is thus central to expertise. Committing things to long-term memory (i.e. learning) is best accomplished by the careful management of cognitive load.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>The following post is basically a straightforward regurgitation of (part of) <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span>. That paper is very readable so there’s really no reason to read the rest of this post. With that out of the way, I liked this paper for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It fairly radically changed my opinion on the value of long-term memory in ways that are practically important</li>
<li>It provides a coherent theory which unifies many phenomena. A coherent theory is easier to remember and easier to apply in novel situations than a disparate collection of facts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-memory">Working memory</h3>
<p>Essentially all human problem-solving is about the manipulation of items in working memory. Alas, our working memory is tragically limited—traditionally, research suggests the upper limit on the number of ‘chunks’ in working memory is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">“magical number seven”</a>. (Interestingly, there’s some evidence that chimpanzees have superior working memory to humans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTgeLEWr614">Video</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(07)02088-X.pdf">paper</a>). Despite this grievous limitation, experience suggests that humans do actually carry out impressive feats of problem-solving. How?</p>
<h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-term memory</h3>
<p>The key is exploiting a ‘loophole’—“huge amounts of organized information can be transferred from long-term memory to working memory without overloading working memory” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span>. Thus, we arrive at the central importance of long-term memory to human cognition. Contra the denigration of rote memorization, “[task-relevant long-term memory] is the only reliable difference that has been obtained differentiating novices and experts in problem-solving skill and is the only difference required to fully explain why an individual is an expert in solving particular classes of problems” <span class="citation" data-cites="sweller2008">(Sweller <a href="#ref-sweller2008">2008</a>)</span>. In other words, long-term memory is necessary and sufficient to explain expertise.</p>
<h4 id="chess-board-recall">Chess board recall</h4>
<p>We can make illustrate these claims with the results of a classic study <span class="citation" data-cites="degroot2014">(De Groot <a href="#ref-degroot2014">2014</a>)</span>. Look at the next image for a few seconds, close your eyes, and try to recall the positions of pieces.</p>

<p>If you’re a chess amateur, this should have been quite hard (i.e. you probably misremembered the pieces). On the other hand, if you’re a chess expert, this was probably fairly straightforward.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>The lazy approach to AI safety suggests that we explicitly encode our moral uncertainty into artificial agents. Then agents can decide to undertake moral investigation via value of information calculations. We make the description of this approach more concrete by examining its application in a nearly trivial setting.</p></div>
       

        <p>Examples often clarify. Let’s see an example of the <a href="./posts/lazy-ai-safety/">lazy approach to AI safety</a> in action.</p>
<h3 id="the-setting">The setting</h3>
<p>Suppose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Professor_(Gilligan%27s_Island)">The Professor</a> has performed another bamboo miracle and built an AI agent on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island">island</a>. Sadly, the castaways forgot the agent in their frantic final escape. So it’s just our agent, alone on an island in the Pacific.</p>
<p>As a man of taste and refinement, the professor has followed the lazy approach to AI safety. As such, the agent’s utility futility is quite simple: The utility of any state of affairs is exactly the moral good of that state of affairs according to whatever turns out to be the <span class="noted">One True Moral Theory (OTMT)</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In symbols, <span class="math inline">\(u(x) = g(x)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="noted"><span class="math inline">\(g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span></span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of possible states of affairs, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the utility function, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> evaluates the moral goodness of a state of affairs according to the OTMT.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we’ll suppose there are only two possible interventions the agent can make: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ze">Ze</a> can harvest coconuts or harvest bamboo. Furthermore, we’ll fiat that there are only two possible moral theories in all the world: the coconut imperative and bamboocentrism. According to the coconut imperative, the goodness of a state of affairs is defined as <span class="math inline">\(g_c(b, c) = 0 \cdot b + 3 \cdot c\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the total number of coconuts that have been harvested and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the total number of bamboo shoots that have been harvested. On the bamboocentric view of things, <span class="math inline">\(g_b(b, c) = 2 \cdot b + 0 \cdot c\)</span>. (The fact that we only have moral theories which express goodness in terms of real numbers permits our earlier simplification of assuming that the OTMT takes this shape.)</p>
<h3 id="initial-behavior">Initial behavior</h3>
<p>Before the Professor <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/will-arnett-UGAwRa9KWjO2Q/fullscreen">abandoned his child</a>, he programmed the agent with a uniform prior over all possible ethical theories. That is, the agent thinks there’s a 50% chance bamboocentrism is true and a 50% chance the coconut imperative is the OTMT. Thus, in the absence of better information, the agent spends zir days harvesting coconuts (we assume the resources required to harvest a coconut are identical to the resources required to harvest a bamboo stalk). To be fully explicit:</p>

<h3 id="ideal-and-non-ideal-theory">Ideal and non-ideal theory</h3>
<p>We’ve already described ideal theory in <a href="./posts/utopia-infinitude-secretaries/">previous posts</a>, but we’ll give a short recap here for the sake of self-sufficiency. Ideal theory suggests that when making decisions about alternative social worlds—that is, about different political and economic institutions, we should have an ideally just society in mind. Non-idealists argue that this information is irrelevant; we only need to be able to perform pairwise comparisons. A popular metaphor in the area is that of mountain climbing. In the language of this metaphor, ideal theorists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a> suggest that mountaineers orient themselves toward Everest while non-idealists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen">Amartya Sen</a> suggest that knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest">Everest</a> is irrelevant when comparing the heights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro">Kilimanjaro</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali">Denali</a>.</p>
<h3 id="thesis">Thesis</h3>
<p>I contend this is a debate which can be <a href="http://askphilosophers.com/question/5254">dissolved</a>. There is no necessary opposition between incrementalism and idealism. Instead, all of these perspectives can be ably unified under the framework of decision theory.</p>
<h3 id="dichotomy">Dichotomy</h3>
<p>Before I can make the argument that’s it’s a <em>false</em> dichotomy, I need to show that it’s a putative dichotomy. There’s little value in attacking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw men</a>. Since I’ve just read <span class="citation" data-cites="gaus2016">(Gaus <a href="#ref-gaus2016">2016</a>)</span>, we’ll examine that in detail and expect that it’s representative of the larger discussion.</p>
<p>The boundary that Gaus draws is between worlds in the ‘neighborhood’ of the status quo and those outside it. If we restrict our attention to worlds in the neighborhood, we’re engaging in non-ideal theory, but if we speculate on distant worlds we’re doing ideal theory. What is this key neighborhood concept? In Gaus’s words: “A neighborhood delimits a set of nearby social worlds characterized by relatively similar justice-relevant social structures.”</p>
<p>So we’re already on firm grounds for a claim of dichotomous thinking. On this view, the <span class="noted">structure of the problem is dichotomous</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. But Gaus also demonstrates the dichotomous view when describing the divergent implications of the ideal and non-ideal view:</p>
<blockquote>
[L]ocal optimization often points in a different direction than pursuit of the ideal. We then confront what I have called <span id="the-choice">The Choice</span>: should we turn our back on local optimization and move toward the ideal? [… O]ur judgments within our neighborhood have better warrant than judgments outside of it; if the ideal is outside our current neighborhood, then we are forgoing relatively clear gains in justice for an uncertain prospect that our realistic utopia lies in a different direction. <span class="noted">Mill’s revolutionaries</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, certain of their own wisdom and judgment, were more than willing to commit society to the pursuit of their vision of the ideal; their hubris had terrible costs for many.
</blockquote>
<h3 id="similarities">Similarities</h3>
<p>Now, I’ll hope you agree ideal and non-ideal theory are framed as incompatible. On that assumption, I’ll begin to argue against the dichotomy.</p>
<h4 id="uncertainty-all-around">Uncertainty all around</h4>
<p>I do accept Gaus’s Neigborhood Constraint—our knowledge of distant social words is much less reliable than our knowledge of worlds similar to the status quo. Furthermore, I think we have non-trivial uncertainties about the workings and justice of worlds that <em>are</em> nearby. Importantly, (though not, I think, crucially) I don’t see any obvious reason for discontinuities in the reliability of our knowledge. My intuition suggests it drops off smoothly with distance from the status quo <span id="reliability" class="spark"></span>.</p>
