        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2013">(Acemoglu and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2013">2013</a>)</span> (and surely elsewhere), Acemoglu and Robinson contend that inclusive societies have inherent economic advantages over stratified (extractive) societies. If true, this is quite important; it suggests that, in the long run, we should <span class="noted">expect inclusive societies to “win” out</span>[^inclusive-win]. The moral arc of the universe bends toward justice and all that.</p>
<h3 id="oligarchs-favor-stability-over-growth">Oligarchs favor stability over growth</h3>
<p>But is it true? As far as I can tell, the best articulation of this claim is in section 6 of <span class="citation" data-cites="acemoglu2005">(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson <a href="#ref-acemoglu2005">2005</a>)</span>. It lays out several claims in support of the argument that oligarchic societies have a structural disadvantage when it comes to economic growth. <a href="./posts/autocrats-accelerate-growth-cooperation/">Last time</a>, we examined their first claim and found it wanting. In this post, we’ll focus on the second:</p>
<blockquote>
Another related source of inefficient economic institutions arises from the desire of political elites to protect their political power. [..] [T]he political elite should evaluate every potential economic change not only according to its economic consequences, such as its effects on economic growth and income distribution, but also according to its political consequences. […] Fearing these potential threats to their political power, the elites may oppose changes in economic institutions that would stimulate economic growth.

<p>I have no problems with this claim in itself.</p>
<h3 id="invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies-again">Invidious majoritarian tyrannies, again</h3>
<p>But I think it tells an incomplete story. It’s not the case that social efficiency can only be impeded by minorities in oligarchic societies. Societies with inclusive institutions can also user their decision-making process to block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks improvements</a>. If a majority weakly prefers A to B while a minority strongly prefers B to A, majority voting will choose A even though this doesn’t necessarily maximize social welfare. This is precisely the <a href="./posts/innocuous-invidious-majoritarian-tyrannies">invidious tyranny of the majority we talked about before</a>. An oligarchic society could well avoid this problem.</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>There are at least two possible interpretations of preference utilitarianism: psychological preference utilitarianism (the morally important part of preference satisfaction is when the preferrer believes it to be satisfied) and metaphysical preference utilitarianism (the morally important part of preference satisfaction is when the world comes into accord with the preference). Each has strange implications. PPU favors deception and gives up intuitive supervenience. MPU requires us to pick us some demarcation criterion; the broadest possible demarcation criterion is a bad candidate.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p><a href="./posts/preference-utilitarianism-psychological-metaphysical-i/">Last time</a> we highlighted that there are actual several possible interpretations of preference utilitarianism. These depend on when you get to a recognize a preference as having been satisfied in your moral accounting: When the world changes to accord with your preference? When you believe the world to have changed? When you have a justified true belief that the world has changed?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll draw out some implications of these views which will also serve as preliminary arguments for and against. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on the two poles: preferences are satisfied when the preferrer believes the world to have changed (purely psychological), and preferences are satisfied when the world has changed (purely metaphysical).</p>
<p>(I’ll also note that I assume advocates of preference utilitarianism implicitly (or explicitly and silently?) believe the psychological variant and my intuition favors it. If I argue against that position more vehemently, it’s only a sign of esteem.)</p>
<h3 id="psychological">Psychological</h3>
<h4 id="deception">Deception</h4>
<p>One obvious but unfortunate implication of the psychological point of view is that self-deception is A-OK. Obligatory even. If I’d like to be create a grand unified theory of physics, I may find it easier to set myself a bastardized version of the problem than to solve the real thing. And if I can deceive myself in this way, the psychological theory of preference utilitarianism (henceforth PPU) makes a prima facie case that I am morally obliged to. (Because this deceptive approach is easier, it means I can satisfy this preference quickly and move on the satisfaction of other preferences rather than sinking vast gobs of time into the ‘authentic’ method.)</p>

         <div class="abstract"><p>Preference utilitarianism involves preferences. Knowing whether a preferences has been satisfied often requires knowing about the world.

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Preference utilitarianism holds that the good a utilitarian ought to maximize is the satisfaction of preferences. Preferences exist in our mind, but (often) refer to the external world. Thus, the satisfaction of preferences must bridge this gap between the mind and the world. That is, if I have a preference for the world to be in a particular state which was once unsatisfied and that very preference is now satisfied, it must be because my beliefs about the world have changed. But beliefs about the world are the domain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a>. Preferences may then be the Trojan horse that smuggle the problems of epistemology into the already troubled camp of ethics.</p>

Certainly fiction-as-ideological vessel carries dangers. And earnest proposals, even without a strong ideological bent, are probably always somewhat at risk of functional exploitation; they may be reduced to a lowest common denominator and turned into dogma, nuance erased. And yet there is a fundamental difference between proposition and persuasion. This could also be framed as the difference between fiction that presents itself as a possible option versus the only solution.

Rickless: [P]lease understand that the takeaway from this kind of research and speculation, as it will likely be processed by journalists and others who may well pick up and run with it, will be that philosophers are shits whose courses turn their students into shits.

<blockquote>
<p>GDP and derived metrics (e.g., productivity) have been central to understanding economic progress and well-being. In principle, the change in consumer surplus (compensating expenditure) provides a superior, and more direct, measure of the change in well-being, especially for digital goods, but in practice, it has been difficult to measure. We explore the potential of massive online choice experiments to measure consumers’ willingness to accept compensation for losing access to various digital goods and thereby estimate the consumer surplus generated from these goods. We test the robustness of the approach and benchmark it against established methods, including incentive compatible choice experiments that require participants to give up Facebook for a certain period in exchange for compensation. The proposed choice experiments show convergent validity and are massively scalable. Our results indicate that <strong>digital goods have created large gains in well-being that are missed by conventional measures of GDP and productivity</strong>. By periodically querying a large, representative sample of goods and services, including those which are not priced in existing markets, changes in consumer surplus and other new measures of well-being derived from these online choice experiments have the potential for providing cost-effective supplements to existing national income and product accounts.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>50% of the Facebook users in our sample would give up all access to Facebook for one month if we paid them about $50 or more.</p>

<p>According to the median WTA estimates for 2017, Search Engines ($17,530 [for a year]) is the most valued category of digital goods followed by Email ($8,414 [for a year]) and digital Maps ($3,648 [for a year]).</p>

[T]he primary aim of philosophic education must be less to instruct than to convert, less to elaborate a philosophical system than to produce that “turning around of the soul” that brings individuals to love and live for the truth. But precisely if the primary end of education is to foster the love of truth, this love cannot be presupposed in the means. The means must rather be based on a resourceful pedagogical rhetoric that, knowing how initially resistant or impervious we all are to philosophic truth, necessarily makes use of motives other than love of truth and of techniques other than “saying exactly what you mean.”

         <div class="abstract"><p>When principals contract with independent agents who know things they don’t, there are costs. Contrary to common connotation, this is sometimes good. For example, we can view the failures outlined in <i>Seeing like a state</i> as warnings about incautious attempts to ignore or eliminate the principal–agent problem. Furthermore, we can view the principal–agent problem as a fundamental constraint on autocrats that limits them when compared to inclusive societies.</p></div>
       

        <h3 id="the-concept">The concept</h3>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal–agent problems</a> occur when a principal enlists an agent to act on their behalf, but the agent has private information and independent interests. This scenario means that the principal incurs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost">agency costs</a> when compared to simply acting themselves.</p>
<p>Examples include brokers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running">front running</a>, doctors <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-who-take-company-cash-tend-to-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs">prescribing medications based on their relationships with pharmaceutical companies</a>, and <a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/taxi-meter3.htm">taxis taking overlong routes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="principal-agent-possibilities">Principal-agent possibilities</h3>
<p>As these examples suggest, principal–agent problems are (I think) usually viewed as a bad thing. And they often are. But they can also be a refuge. To see this, we just have to flip our sympathies. The common examples encourage us to sympathize with the principal and see the agent as abusing their power.</p>
<p>Examples from the flipped perspective include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Micromanager</dt>
<dd>If your manager at work is a petty tyrant, you surely appreciate and exploit whatever gaps in their knowledge you can find to work in ways you believe more effective or just to preserve your psychological health.
</dd>
<dt>Overbearing parents</dt>
<dd>Some parents seem to think of their children as agents in the project of aggrandizing themselves. Children in this situation may justly find that moving out–an increase in agency costs—represents a gift.
