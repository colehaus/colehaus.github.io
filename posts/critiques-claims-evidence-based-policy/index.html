  <h3 id="man-of-straw">Man of straw</h3>
<p>It seems to me that <i>Evidence-based Policy</i>’s description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity">external validity</a> as a “rules system” is something of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man</a>. I <span class="noted">doubt</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that researchers are rule-based automata applying the dictum of external validity unthinkingly. When evaluating whether the population, time and place are “similar” enough for the original study to have external validity, researchers surely interpret the direction and degree of similarity with care.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> offers <span class="noted">no real description of these supposed rules of external validity</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. The closest I can find to a systematized procedure is <span class="citation" data-cites="khorsan2014external">(Khorsan and Crawford <a href="#ref-khorsan2014external" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Which is not very close. It’s just three domains each rated on a three point scale. And rating those domains requires considerable human judgment.</p>
<h3 id="tu-quoque"><i>Tu quoque</i></h3>
<p>If <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> were to back off from its straw man and allow that people think about external validity with discretion, we’d see that all the critiques of external validity apply similarly (see what I did there?) to the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach with causal principles.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../posts/yaas-evidence-based-policy/">the summary</a>, I reorganized their critique of external validity a bit. To ensure that I’m not critiquing a distortion, I’ll match their original presentation here.</p>
<h4 id="the-advice-is-vague">The advice is vague</h4>
<p><abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> complains that external validity’s guidance to apply the “same treatment” is vague. It only works if “you have identified the right description for the treatment”. But this complaint can be applied to the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach too. An intervention only travels from there to here via the <a href="../../posts/yaas-evidence-based-policy/#thesis">effectiveness argument</a> if we find the right formulation of the causal (sub)principle. This is exactly what <a href="../../posts/yaas-evidence-based-policy/#vertical-search">vertical search</a> was about!</p>
<p><a href="../../posts/yaas-evidence-based-policy/#vignette">The Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Program worked (TINP) and the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Program didn’t</a> and it doesn’t much matter if you say that’s because “same treatment” was too vague or if you say it’s because vertical search failed to turn up the right description of the causal principle at work.</p>
<p>On either approach, mechanical application fails and discretion is required for success.</p>
<h4 id="similarity-is-too-demanding">Similarity is too demanding</h4>
<p><abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> makes fun of a study that says:</p>
<blockquote>
Thus [Moving to Opportunity] data … are strictly informative only about this population subset—people residing in high-rise public housing in the mid-1990’s, who were at least somewhat interested in moving and sufficiently organized to take note of the opportunity and complete an application. The MTO results should only be extrapolated to other populations if the other families, their residential environments, and their motivations for moving are similar to those of the MTO population. <span class="attribution"><span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig2008can">(Ludwig et al. <a href="#ref-ludwig2008can" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>If our bar for similarity is this high, why even bother with a study that will never travel, <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> asks. But I think the above conclusion is actually semi-reasonable.</p>
<p>First, the authors are clearly being conservative in some regards. They don’t actually mean that the information expired with the mid-1990s. That’s a shorthand for a variety of factors which they expect are relevant but they haven’t individuated. It will be up to future policymakers and researchers to use their dIsCrEtIoN to determine whether all those implicit factors are present in new circumstances and this intelligent interpretation is an expected part of external validity—not a gross breach.</p>
<p>Second, it sounds a lot to me like the authors of the critiqued study are trying to identify the support factors that <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> loves. We could rewrite this in <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr>ese: “The intervention only plays a positive causal role if it’s supported by dissatisfaction with current housing and sufficient conscientiousness.”.</p>
<p>Finally, we could say that identifying support factors in the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach is too demanding. If we just listed off every fact we knew about the context of the original intervention and called it a support factor, it would clearly be extremely demanding—nowhere else would have this precise combination of support factors. It’s only by filtering proposed support factors through human judgment that we get a more manageable set and escape the demandingness critique. But if we move away from the straw man version of external validity and allow ourselves to apply judgment there too, then we can say that an intervention context only has to be similar in certain ways—thereby escaping the demandingess critique.</p>
<!--more-->
<h4 id="similarity-is-the-wrong-idea">Similarity is the wrong idea</h4>
<p><abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> says that similarity is just the wrong idea. By this, I think it means that similarity is demanded without an underlying rationale. It returns to the <abbr title="Moving to Opportunity">MTO</abbr> example excerpted above and says that it demands a random, nonsensical assortment of similarities. I think this is just plain uncharitable. I can think of many worse similarities to demand. For example, we could claim the <abbr title="Moving to Opportunity">MTO</abbr> study only has external validity if the follow-up policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starts on the same day of the month as the original policy</li>
<li>Is also implemented under a president with the first name Bill</li>
<li>Is also called the “Moving to Opportunity Experiment”</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we accept the argument that the list of similarities required for external validity by the <abbr title="Moving to Opportunity">MTO</abbr> study is a bad one, the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach doesn’t inoculate us from the problem of making bad demands with respect to effectiveness. <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> says that the <abbr title="Moving to Opportunity">MTO</abbr> study should have tried to explicitly identify support factors. But there’s no guarantee that this would succeed! Just thinking in terms of causal principles and support factors doesn’t mean we’ll automatically get them right. We could still end up with missing or extraneous support factors and <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> would still make fun of us unless we used the magic words, I guess.</p>
<p>In other words, it seems just about as hard to determine which contextual factors are actually support factors as it is to determine which similarities are important and which are irrelevant.</p>
<h4 id="similarity-is-wasteful">Similarity is wasteful</h4>
<p>As we mentioned in a footnote last time, <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> complains that external validity’s demand for similarity is wasteful. What we really want is conditions that are at least as favorable. I have to think that adherents to the external validity approach would readily acknowledge deviations from similarity in certain directions are tolerable.</p>
<p>But this is an extra degree of freedom and with freedom comes responsibility. Our intuitions and models aren’t always correct about the sign of association between two factors. We might think that an intervention is more likely to work the poorer the target population is and be wrong.</p>
<p>So with either the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach or the external validity approach, reasonable adherents would allow us to apply the intervention in circumstances more favorable than the original trial. But in both cases we’d have to careful to know what “more favorable” actually means.</p>
<h3 id="biting-bullets">Biting bullets</h3>
<p>These bullets are delicious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we show how the <span class="noted">orthodoxy</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, which is a rules system, discourages decision makers from thinking about their problems, because the aim of rules is to reduce or eliminate the use of discretion and judgment, and deliberation requires discretion and judgment. The aim of reducing discretion comes from a lack of trust in the ability of operatives to exercise discretion well.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
To tell people that they have to follow your rules for assessing evidence for effectiveness requires that you think that the rules will produce a better result than allowing them to think. This requires some combination of lack of confidence in their ability to think, and high confidence in the general applicability of the rules.
</blockquote>
<p>I think the replication crisis is very clear evidence that trusting the discretion and judgment of operatives is not a winning strategy. Not necessarily because the operatives are ignorant or malignant, but because the task at hand is apparently very hard. And the replication crisis is mostly about internal validity. External validity seems like an even harder problem where discretion can be even more problematic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have already said that I am skeptical of characterizing the external validity approach as a rules system. But this is lamentable! I think we should be pushing toward a world where we can codify these procedures and eliminate discretion, not promoting discretion as <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> does.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Obviously, there are a lot of complaints here. What’s left after we sort through them?</p>
<p>Both <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> and I agree that it’s currently ill-advised to apply rules without exercising discretion. <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr>’s proposal is to embrace discretion and mine is to improve the rules.</p>
<p><abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> describes the external validity orthodoxy as a “rules system”. I think this is inaccurate. If it’s inaccurate and we admit that adherents of the external validity approach also apply discretion, then all of <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr>’s other complaints about external validity (vague, too demanding, wrong, wasteful) apply equally to the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach. Neither approach is strictly superior on these grounds.</p>
<p>I also interpret <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> as arguing for the value of theory and models in addition to raw empiricism. I’m fully on-board with this. But I don’t think theories and models are incompatible with the external validity approach. This is perhaps the key contribution of <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> for me—emphasizing that considerations of external validity (e.g. ecological validity, population validity) ought to foreground possible causal principles.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it mostly seems like the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> approach and external validity are different languages for talking about the same problem. Use the <abbr title="Evidence-based Policy">EBP</abbr> language if it helps you think about the problem more clearly.</p>
